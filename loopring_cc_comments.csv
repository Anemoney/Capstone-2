"Ya, from the perspective of a user, no gas fees to trade. They only pay trading fees. In the case of Loopring.io, it's: 0% maker, 0.06%-0.1% taker (aka very low :). And it's not like this is being abstracted, when they make a trade - they are truly not making an on-chain tx. They are making a layer-2 (zkRollup) transaction, which is gasless, and just updates the state of a Merkle tree.

It is the DEX owner-operator who comes into contact with / and pays for gas. When DEX has received/processed a big batch of the layer-2 trades mentioned above, it 'seals' them, proves them in a zkSNARK proof, and submits this batch + proof onto Ethereum, which verifies it. The DEX operator pays one 'fixed overhead' gas cost to submit the big batch (which may contain ~2000 trades for example). And that fixed overhead cost is ~220,000 gas in our case - which is in fact what a single layer-1 trade used to cost us! But as you see, now it is being amortized over 2000 trades. That's why it is so cheap :).

So the efficiency comes from some actor aggregating a lot of txs into a batch ('rolling them up'), and submitting them at once. And this splits the cost. And everything in the batch is verifiably correct due to the magic math of Zero Knowledge cryptography!

Please see this 5 minute overview post if it interests you, as I skipped over some details: https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-3-0-overview-from-a-to-zksnarks-2c542e6c07b0

Thanks.

edit: to put the gas cost for the DEX to settle trades into $ terms instead of gas terms, Loopring-based DEXs can settle a trade on Ethereum for $0.000124. Or 1 million trades for $124 dollars. That's why the DEX can offer its users such tiny trade fees: it has low operating costs.",1590445645,frt96t7

"Hey all. Loopring Exchange ([https://loopring.io](https://loopring.io)) - the first and only zkRollup DEX on Ethereum listed DXD today. [https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1264961973466300417?s=20](https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1264961973466300417?s=20)

DXD is the newly launched token of the DXdao ([http://dxdao.eth.link/](http://dxdao.eth.link/)).

You can now trade DXD-ETH with instant execution, no gas fees, 200 TPS, and the absolute self-custodial security of Ethereum. And ETH really means ETH here, not WETH :).

Because we have been members of the DXdao since inception, we offer a special code for this occasion: input ""**DXDAO**"" when registering on [Loopring.io](https://Loopring.io) , and receive VIP4 status for 1 year: 0.06% taker, 0% maker fees. And recall, because Loopring is a zkRollup, those fees are all-in, NO gas required at all once on the rollup.

"Yes, Ethereum itself is a blockchain that has many tokens running on it. Think of it like an arcade. A DEX(decentralized exchange) allows a person to hold these tokens in their own wallet, yet set a sell or buy to make a transaction, all without ""depositing"" your tokens to some other custody such as Binance.

Think of tokens just like a video game arcade. You use cash to buy tokens, then you are able to play the video games. Ethereum tokens are like this, only with Eth itself, since it is a blockchain and not a token, first you have to ""wrap"" your Eth, so that it obtains the properties that Eth tokens have, namely the erc-20 standards that allow one to trade.

Therefore, to use a DEX, you have your wallet, namely MEW, with a little Ethereum in it. Via the DEX you choose, you can take a portion of your Eth and wrap it. That is a one to one ratio, so you would trade for an equal amount of wEth. Then you can set up trades, and they will execute, all without you ever having to give up your keys to a third party. Loopring has set up the most advanced DEX tech wise, but just like Kyber, it needs more users to be more liquid. There is also Bancor, Airswap and Uniswap.",1590433715,frsmtj2
"Every scaling solution has trade-offs. 

We trade off general purpose EVM execution for a more stateless UTXO model that can be trivially validated in parallel on consumer grade hardware. Our projects primary focused is on optimistic transactions and exchanging, namely for scaling stable coin payments.

Optimism is building a fully fledged EVM-like design which will have different state and scaling criteria from ours. Starkware, Matter Labs and Loopring are using snarks/starks to achieve all sorts of scaling solutions.

All projects will boast high throughput, each with their own pros and cons (tradeoffs).

"Ethereum is about to gain exposure to millions of reddit users when this community points feature gets expanded. That's millions of users getting an eth wallet, interacting with smart contracts in the background, enabling them to trade their community points. 

They can sell their points for stablecoins like DAI or USDC, then lend them out to earn interest on them or participate in PoolTogether, a no-loss-lottery. Of course there's a much broader DeFi space for them to explore too, I was just naming some of the more mundane things you can do.

Apart from that, Phase 0 is going to launch this year almost certainly, with the deposit contract launching for PoS. Phase 1 will not take as long to launch after that because development for it has been done concurrently to the Phase 0 development.

Apart from *that*, Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions are either already on mainnet (Optimistic rollups, ZKsnarks; Loopring DEX as an example); or for example Matic utilising Plasma to scale Ethereum transactions is going to hit Mainnet in the coming months.

"&gt;And then it's locked away.. Meaning it reduces the available supply to exchanges, which in turn puts upward price pressure.

It's not locked away, it's traded in a different, more liquid form. Centralized exchanges can easily accept it directly as 'bitcoin'.  

&gt;So again, this is tremendously beneficial to Bitcoin.

Fees are paid in eth, users have to own eth and know how to use ethereum. It's an enormous value loss for bitcoin, as once the use of pegged btc grows big enough it becomes just another fundamentally worthless erc20 like hex or 0xbtc. All pegged tokens subtract value from the native chain.  

&gt;They're all priced in Bitcoin.

That was last true in early 2017. Everything is priced in usd now.  
ETHUSDT on Binance - $184,900,637  
ETHBTC on Binance - $41,999,083  
ETHUSD on Bitfinex - $22,828,874  
ETHBTC on Bitfinex - $2,905,476  
Crypto btc pairs only follow the usd demand due to arbitrage. As I wrote, nothing relies on btc today. It could disappear - the network suddenly stops completely - with minimal repercussions.  

The last remnants of btc's former domination are centralized exchanges like binance and bitmex - but they're going to lose to non-custodial exchanges on ethereum. Bitfinex is going to release one this year - with support for thousands of TPS thanks to zk-rollups. There's already loopring with up to 2k tps. Nobody sane is going to remain on custodial exchanges.  

The total volume on bitfinex in the last 24 hours is only 22 times larger than just uniswap's - the difference was over 1000 times a year ago. This trend is not going to stop.

&gt;Why do you think every single altcoin, eth included, follows Bitcoin's price swings?

Delusion, moving together is different from following.  Unfortunately there's lots of index trading going on.  

&gt;I'm talking on average.  

As percentage of block rewards, it's consistently much higher than bitcoin. In dollar value it's smaller, but that's going to change with higher throughput.

One interesting point is that interesting is that it will actually get much cheaper for us to settle trades when MORE users come in and are trading more often.

On average, should take 3-30 mins. You can see that on the exchange. It may take a bit longer (some hrs) in the early days, only because we wait for big enough batches to process things more efficiently. Batching is where we get the 1000x throughput gains in first place. Of course, once on the DEX, trades happen instantly, not even 3-30 mins. 

But I understand what the author may have conflated the '2 weeks' with: at the protocol level, there is an enforcement which can ""kill"" an exchange if the exchange hasn't processed something that is 2 weeks old.

And now it's implemented. Maker orders earn 8% of the trading fee that the taker pays. By default, that is 1.6bps. So any maker order that gets filled earns 1.6bps of the trade value. Of course, as a zkRollup, there is no gas fees. So makers earn fees for providing liquidity, full stop.

Also, the taker fee schedule has changed. Now spanning 0.06% to 0.2%, previously was 0.06% to 0.1%. Again, no gas. So as you see, shifting the benefits a bit to makers to try and incentivize some extra liquidity on the books :).

Also, the API now supports 'post-only' orders, allowing makers to have more precision and ensure they are always adding liquidity, not removing.

The plan is to create incentives on POS to have people slowly move their ETH to the new chain. And eventually the old network becomes obsolete. Then ETH 1.x will be forked to become a shard on ETH 2.0. The estimated timeline is 3 years. But ETH 2.0 phase 0 with staking is on the timeline to be finished by the end of the year. The testnet for phase 0 is going to launch in 3 days. L2 solutions like optimistic rollups and plasma are being implemented into dapps as we speak to help ease the transition of scaling before sharding is available. If you have any doubts about any of these things i would say research things like POS, sharding, optomistic rollups, plasma. All of these mechanisms are currently existing as products you can use and try, whether that be zk labs, loopring, omise go, tezos, cardano, zilliqa. So these terms are not made up. They are very real. Also you have to ask why businesses like EY are building mainstream financial products on ETH like nightfall, which uses zk rollups. ETH has the most active developers and most over all development of any blockchain. Theres thousands of people developing on ETH around the globe. So if you think thousands of people are submitting vaporware codes on github then it is an extremely elaborate scheme.

For now the team are covering the fees, but if they weren't they would be absurdly low anyway, like $0.0002 USD per settlement. For now LRC3.0 can settle around 2k TPS but the team is already working on LPC 3.5 and LPC 4.0 so there are further developments to come.

"Proposal: launch MOONS via zkSync. zkSync is matterlab's implementation of zkRollup technology. Unlike xDAI or Loopring, there is no token or ulterior reason to use zkSync aside from that it works and meets reddit's requirements the best.

Unlike sidechains like xDAI there, finality on the Ethereum mainnet is still within one block, and there is no parallel sidechain that needs to be stored by validators in perpetuity.

Unlike sidechains like xDAI, the transactions per second is 2000, compared to 70.

Implementation involves just one transaction to move the necessary float of MOONS to the zkSYNC contract, and distribute them to the appropriate addresses. Any address can retrieve their holdings on the zkSYNC.

Transaction fees are paid in MOON (the token being used), so it is the best of all worlds.

Any wallet or user experience should just be using zksync natively behind the scenes, so all users would just be moving tokens around quickly. There can be exchanges on zkSync.

"Loopring has no Ethereum network fees, and a very low per trade exchange fee, once your funds have been deposited in the zkRollUp smart contract. It can offer massive scalability and no Ethereum transaction fees while also being completely trustless, with the operator having no ability to steal or freeze your funds, because it uses zkRollUp compression to keep all trading data on-chain.

Deversifi is similar and has no exchange fees at all, but it has slightly more trust assumptions, as the data is held off-chain. With Deversifi's offchain scalability solution, the operator still can't steal your funds, but it's theoretically possible that both the operator and Data Availability Committee (DAC), who are there to act as backups, disappear, and your funds become unrecoverable. So you have to trust Deversifi and/or one of the members of the DAC to at least keep the data on the off-chain trades available to you.

If you want to participate in some of the larger lending/borrowing markets on Ethereum, you can use one of the leading DeFi apps like Compound, but unlike Loopring and Deversifi, it has no zero-knowledge proof logic to reduce/eliminate fees, so you'll have to pay quite a bit in Ethereum transaction fees on every trade.",1594397543,fxjkara

"Yup, this is right. Free means free for users, because the Loopring zkRollup makes costs so negligible. Everything settled to Ethereum costs \*something\*, a user just doesn't pay it/ see it. When we submit a batch + proof of settled trades or transfers to Ethereum, that costs us gas. But that is like \~300k gas that can be amortized over 1000+ trades (optimally it is amortized over 4096 trades). So we pay that gas, it's like a fixed overhead cost (plus actually a small incremental cost of 365 gas per trade). So that is all being handled by the zkRollup 'operator'. All a user sees is a trading fee, as if they were on a CEX. 0.06%-0.1% for takers, and 0% for makers. We can afford to charge those very cheap fees for similar reason as above. And for payments, we don't charge any fees. Our costs, in optimal conditions, is $0.000124 per trade, and $0.00006 for a transfer. That's why fees can be cheap or free :).",1594301336,fxf54zs

"&gt;There is no evidence the market is controlled..

You're right in that regard, but Tether definitely seems extremely shady. Their last audit was more than 2 years ago, and at this point, almost everyone thinks it's fractional reserve.

I also think it's extremely weird that the price doesn't seem to be organic in any way. Everytime the price reaches $10k, hodlonaut makes a tweet saying ""this will be the last time to get Bitcoin at $10k"", and then the price suddenly tanks. I feel like it's a game among whales to get peoples' hopes up, make them but high, and then dump to move the price down, but this just a theory.

&gt;Meanwhile, the infrastructure that the market operates on is undergoing revolutionary changes in 2020. These are changes that were nothing but the wildest dreams of cypherpunks in 2011. See the growth of DEXes on Ethereum:

&gt;https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-exchange-volumes-up-70-in-june-pass-1-5-billion

I really hope DEXs put centralized exchanges out of business. They make it harder for exchanges to trade against customers, and people don't have to worry about another Mt.Gox situation. So far, Ethereum seems to be doing well, and I hope it succeeds.

&gt;Not to be overly optimistic:

&gt;The one place where the market has actually degraded is in the area of privacy as analytics companies have been able to increasingly expose users and their activity using chain analysis. 

&gt;The privacy tech hasn't kept up or at least hasn't been deployed widely enough to counteract these trends.

Do L2 solutions on Ethereum like ZkRollups, Ren, and Loopring solve this? I haven't kept up to date much with Ethereum.

"Former owner here who profited quite extensively especially when McAfee shilled DGB in 2017.  No I am not wrong at all.  We just disagree and I have good reason to do so while you have not provided any counterargument.

Really, your reply didn't dispute any of what I said.  What does DGB bring to the table that clearly beats out all other dominant assets in their fields of specialty?  It doesn't matter if you try to do everything but cannot excel the most in that field.  To even state that ETH only does smart contracts and nothing more is absurd.  Of course ETH does far, far more.  I'm not sure how you can even argue that DGB is comparable to ETH in that regard.  Try to convince this sub and let us see how that goes. We haven't even brought ADA, Tezos, and EOS into the mix.

Most other projects are decentralized and secure enough for users to not give any concern.  It doesn't matter if there are 5 algorithms involved in DGB's mining. Its decentralization is nothing really special.  You are likely aware of the discussions regarding the findings that DGB's mining has been dominated by a single entity.  I won't delve much on that but wouldn't be remotely surprised if everything were true.

Saying that ICX is a one-trick pony means you do not understand it at all.  It is an interconnecting blockchain that will grow and connect to other South Korean private and national government projects.  There's nothing that DGB does that it can't do better, faster, and more efficiently.  The only thing DGB can claim in this regard is that it's not overseen by a single entity.  ICX is but one of many new coins that has instant, immutable confirmation with extremely minimal fees.  Even Binance only requires ONE confirmation which is instantaneous for ICX.  Your statement, without expounding, simply looks uninformed.

To be realistic, see if you can convince anyone here that DGB's security can even remotely compare to BTC's as well as to any non-mining consensus coin.  The overwhelming majority of new assets coming out today are now moving to variants of PoS, DPoS, ORV, and such.  They make sense.  They are inevitable.

PoW is unsustainable in the future, however long you want to stretch that time line.  This is partly why DGB will have no more inflation after 15 or so years.  But what is the plan after that?  For most assets, adopting a more advanced and realistic form of consensus is an inevitability.  Even Bitcoin will have a similar problem without any tail emission 120 or so years from now but maximalists just ignore that problem now.  Truth is it will be controversial and may even bring about more forks, drama, and absurd developments.  This is also the reason why Monero has plans to forever have tail emission although I strongly disagree and urge the developers to consider a non PoW consensus.

As for Nano, it is the purest, most efficient, fastest decentralized value transfer protocol in existence today.  So simple in philosophy that anything can practically be built on top of it.  It's not encumbered by rent-seeking or fees. The feeless nature of the asset will always give it value. This is exactly the same reason that people keep tabs on and put any value on IOTA.  If coordicide does successfully happen, consider many, many other assets as dead coins.  Take away the feeless nature of these projects (Nano, IOTA, and even to an extent, Loopring), and most speculation and perceived value in these projects will evaporate.  These will forever be thorns to other assets, especially to coins like DGB because they chiefly try to be fast coins.  All of these so-called fast coins fall in the same category with some variant or so - COTI, Nimiq, DGB, GRS, Dash (which I do not like but outperforms DGB in most relevant metrics), and if we add 0-conf to the mix due to slower blocks, you have the coins running on antiquated PoW like BCH, LTC, BSV, VTC, Feathercoin, and the list goes on and on and on.

The bar has been set very high.  If a better, faster, more efficient, sufficiently decentralized, deflationary, and feeless asset comes out that outperforms my holdings in most, if not every comparable and relevant metric, then I will support that coin. DGB does not stir even the slightest interest - not for payments, not for smart contracts capability, not for DeFi, or anything else that is considered ""hot"" today.  Again, it's a jack-of-all trades, unremarkable in all.  You can tout decentralization but even that is suspect for some, and does not matter for many.

We can agree to disagree about it, but I don't believe there's anything more you can add that will convince me or the ones in the know.  But you can most certainly argue and try.",1593561796,fwj6el9

So who are we waiting on to implement zkRollUp so that transaction fees get decimated again?  Does everyone have to use LoopRing, or do all the existing platforms need to devote time to incorporating this new technology into their existing platforms?

Looping (and other rollups) are awesome for Ethereum, but they're not really direct competitors to Nano imo. They come with their own challenges, similar to the Lightning Network (though with less caveats then LN). Loopring for example:

1. Loopring isn't really feeless, they're just subsidizing the transaction fees for now: ""The Loopring protocol requires us to process every user request, including account registration, account-key-reset, deposits, and withdrawals. We charge fees to cover Zero-Knowledge proof cost and Ethereum transaction gas fee, and also to avoid Sybil attack.""

2. You're still reliant on 1st layer Ethereum fees and conf times if you want to onboard/offboard your Loopring ETH or ERC20s for storage or to use with 1st layer services that haven't implemented Loopring

3. Loopring v3 offers the same level of security as Eth IF On-Chain Data Availability (OCDA) is turned on (depends on the service's implementation of the Loopring protocol). Turning that on reduces scalability a little bit (still really high, so not a big worry), but without it you're relying on a 3rd party to keep some of the data. Meaning that in an extreme case a government could shutdown that service. So, make sure the Loopring services you're using have OCDA enabled

4. Exchanges, wallets, and DEXs have to integrate Loopring tech

5. Loopring DEXs don't automatically support all ERC20s, there's some integration work that has to be done

6. Loopring Pay transfers happen on their zkRollup, meaning the recipient must also be on it (have to register first)

7. Your funds can be locked up for 24 hours if the Loopring service you're using goes down

8. Individual Loopring services could censor your Loopring transactions, potentially forcing you to exit the contract",1592180687,fuup4b3

"Hey all. Matt from Loopring here. I've enjoyed our discussions over past few weeks with the community here, so just wanted to let you know (especially the more hard core traders amongst you), Loopring Exchange ([Loopring.io](https://Loopring.io)) is hosting its first ""liquidity mining"" competition beginning June 15, and lasting for one month. 6000 USDT in rewards.

"Pasting this here from my post on r/maticnetwork

I've seen  a little bit of this commentary recently, so i'll try to address it in a single post for clarity. Please pay it forward by educating others when you can.

Mostly it refers to the question of ""Does Ethereum launching EIP-1559/Improving their scaling/the launch of Optimism compromise the goals of Polygon?"". Mostly the question is driven by the fear of - am I in the right spot with my investment positions. I won't answer that question (diversify, invest in what you use, use what you invest in, sell the top!), but I will address the first with a few points:

1.	⁠⁠What is Ethereum 2.0? Despite conjecture, the Eth2 roadmap is already significantly complete. The beacon chain has been launched (http://beaconcha.in) since December. The next milestones remain to complete ""The Merge"" of both chains into a single Proof of Stake instance, and then to complete Data Sharding later. There's a lot more complex research to it, but that's the most important. These milestones improve the utillity of the base Layer (see more later), but don't increase TPS by any orders of magnitude. The complicated computational sharding that people continue to refer to as ""Ethereum 2.0"" is not happening. This is a good thing, it was always a difficult endeavour and priorities change. So how does Ethereum scale without computational sharding?
2.	⁠⁠Polygon is Ethereum 2.0 - Alongside Loopring, Optimism, ZkSnarks, ImmutableX etc, Layer 2 is the future architecture of Ethereum. You can read more here: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698 Ultimately, we are going to need all of these experiments and maybe more, and hopefully multiple technologies become viable and provide separate cost/time/security trade-offs for different dApps. For example, ImmutableX is laser focused on gaming NFTs. The only difference is that Polygon is taking a multi-technology approach, rather than a narrow single technology approach. This is ambitous, but they intend to offer all of these options under a single umbrella. As we move to an inter-chain world, this will hopefully pay off in terms of User Experience. But they will need to work closely with other teams to get this done, and that is what they're doing.
3.	⁠⁠EIP-1559 supports this vision - in this world, we need a reliable Layer 1, where roll-ups and sidechains that Polygon deploy can be consistenly and regularly checkpointed to the base chain. Gas will likely remain high on Ethereum due to roll-up demand, so EIP-1559 and Data Sharding are important projects to supercharge the base layer. While they won't give it magical scaling powers to reduce gas to zero, they will make it much more functional in a multi-roll-up world.
4.	⁠⁠Demand vs Supply - This is the classic, nobody goes there it's too crowded scenario. While it might feel like these projects are competing to provide supply, the correct way to think about it is that they are working together to ensure demand. And right now demand is far outstripping supply. While this causes the chaos of high gas, it's super healthy for the network and smart people are working very hard to build into it and overcome it. It could get messy with liquidity mining and incentive wars to bring dApps and developers into each L2 stack, but ultimately - the goal is to scale Ethereum so that people continue to want to use it - and that goal is synergistic.
5.	⁠⁠A multi-chain future - So yes, we're going to have multiple competing technologies, but we'll likely have teams working together, mergers and lots of fun to come, but the Polygon vision to combine these all under one roof makes them both a unique and an exciting prospect and an important part of the Ethereum community. Hopefully we can avoid as much bitterness and uncertainty as possible (and there will be others trying to stoke this doubt), so it's important we keep these values in mind and build towards a harmonious multi-chain future.

I hope that helps! :)",1615450411,gqjt7m0

"Thanks for the detailed response! I've got some counters:

&gt; making several hard forks completely imperceptible to the average user

From my perspective, Ethereum upgrades/hard forks have also been imperceptible, how does Cardano improve this user experience?

&gt; Native tokens - solves an important network usage and efficiency problem

I agree that native tokens are a good idea, but I tend to feel that the scalability improvements of these tokens are overstated.

On Ethereum, it costs about 2x to move a token vs. Ether, so I would assume that native tokens would cut the token transfer costs by roughly 1/2. Still a great improvement! But not game-changing

&gt; Babel fees

I haven't seen how this will work in practice, nor do I see how this is an improvement over Ethereum's relayer model. You can already try wallets like Argent or Loopring that let you pay your fee in any token you'd like

&gt; IELE virtual machine 

On one hand, I'm always a fan of advancements in the VM space! The IELE looks pretty great although I'd love to read a more detailed comparison between it and a WASM virtual machine.

&gt; variety of common programming languages (e.g. javascript, C++, etc.).

No offense, but when I read people post this, I know they haven't written smart contracts before.

The language is not the difficult part of writing smart contracts. Solidity is based on JavaScript and it's actually a pretty easy language to pick up for a JS dev, meanwhile Python devs can use Vyper, Closure devs can use LLL, Rust devs have a number of contract languages, etc. EOS contracts are built with low-level languages like C++, etc.

Smart contracts are hard because they're just very different paradigms to program in. Giving access to new languages isn't going to make it easier to build smart contracts, in fact it will likely fragment the amount of resources available to developers.

&gt; Project Catalyst and the on-chain treasury

This one comes down to more of a philosophical difference: I don't think on chain governance is a good thing to be built at the protocol level, and open governance over such a large treasury will lead to corruption.

It's not like I don't think there should be open-decentralized ways of funding projects. Ethereum has Moloch DAO as well as Gitcoin Grants, both of which have been super successful, and theres always more experiments going on. But that's exactly what they should be: _experiments_, and I fear cementing this governance &amp; treasury into Cardano's base protocol will become very messy if there are flaws in the system.",1615369340,gqfhq62

ETH has a myriad of scaling solutions being implemented including ETH 2.0 but most certainly not limited to it. 

Chainlink just came out with an update to save 90% gas for their contracts. Dapps are finally taking scaling serious, as before they were more concerned about users. It is happening incrementally, but it is a not a light switch and over time things get efficient enough for the demand in place. Optimism is only just releasing, other layer 2s like loopring and even sidechains like matic and XDAI also gaining usage. If people want to gamble on high speculative shit coins and copy cats on BSC all day, well just look at Tron for what you get when you copy every dapp under the sun, no pun intended.

1st post! I’m wondering about loopring before the L2 upgrade to ethereum. It has a solid team and I often find them referred to as “team keeps their head down and focused on their work” and that they’re teamed up with chain link if I remember that correctly. I’m still looking into zero proof knowledge concepts but I like the idea of it possibly lowering the gas fees of Eth,1614393057,goxevff
"Lol ethereum's fees problem will be long gone when those projects actually release on cardano. Optimism is releasing next month on mainnet. Coinbase is thinking about implementing it. Chainlink cut (THIS WEEK) 90% of its gas usage by doing calculations off chain, the loopring exchange is gaining momentum, uniswap v3 will be released soon. all of that will reduce the pain on eth's network even before phase 1 of 2.0 gets released. Cardano better take it up the next gear because they will soon be dragging behind (imo they already are, 3 years and only staking is released smh)

"Yeah but you probably heard about Gogen launching in March and all the ETH dapps preparing to abandon ship, and BSC already taking all the valuable Ethereum transactions via their cloned dapps on a centralized chain.

Hard to stay on track with all the noise but this here is THE signal, pay attention. Ethereum has a multifaceted upgrade process including Eth 2.0 beacon chain, merging chains (eth 1 &amp; eth 2), roll-ups (like with optimism discussed by OP, and ZK rollups like what Loopring already uses), and eventually sharding (no other chain has sharding implemented that I can tell yet). On top of that there are regular L2's like XDAI and Matic successfully running dapps, games, and DOAs. Ethereum is branching out it's profile across the entire asset spectrum and there will be many successful ways it will scale.

"Definitely going to be a few years. Optimism launch is soon, but we’re a long way from a fully built layer 2 ecosystem. 

Loopring uses ZKswaps for layer 2. Say I wanted to buy eth, use loopring, then use uniswap. I’d have to buy on an exchange, pay a layer 1 fee to withdrawal, pay a fee to send it to the layer 2 protocol for loopring, trade, pay a fee to send it back to layer 1, then pay a fee to it send to uniswap’s optimism layer 2 protocol, trade, and then pay a fee to send back to layer 1.

If you have several tokens that use different protocols for layer 2 liquidity mining dapps then things get messy real quick. That’s assuming everything switches to layer 2 right away and we don’t get split half and half on layer 2 and layer 1 for a while. On top of that we’ve got the transition to staking and the fight over EIP-1559.

I typically like to keep 60-70% in BTC &amp; ETH. And in that 60-70% of BTC &amp; ETH I like to keep it at 80% BTC and 20% ETH. (Not currently at that right now, but my daily DCA should catch that up).

From a sector perspective I am most invested in Currencies (56%), then Smart Contract Platforms (32%), and then DeFi (11%).  Allocations below:

Bitcoin (BTC) - 50%

Ethereum (ETH) - 15%

Polkadot (DOT) - 8%

DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) - 7%

Avalanche (AVAX) - 6%

Litecoin (LTC) - 3%

ZCash (ZEC) - 3%

Reef Finance (REEF) - 3%

Cosmos (ATOM) - 1%

Algorand (ALGO) - 1%

Tezos (XTZ) - 1%

Sushi Swap (SUSHI) - 1%

Dust - 1.17%

&amp;#x200B;

Notes on some of the larger holdings:

Bitcoin - What is there to say? Tesla, MicroStrategy, PayPal, Square, MassMutual. Lightning Network is evolving...at a snail's pace, but it's getting there. Wrapped BTC, RenBTC, etc, etc. People don't google search ""CryptoCurrency"" they search ""Bitcoin"". Taproot/Schnorr will improve privacy and scaling a bit. I could go on and on and on and on.

Ethereum - ""The Everything Marketplace"". DeFi, Stablecoins, Wrapped BTC, Eth2, Vitalik Buterin, NFTs. The only downside right now is scalability and gas fees which is starting to get a little pressure relief from L2s like Loopring. I could talk hours about Ethereum and BTC. They are the TOP DOGS with HUGE networks and the largest developer pools.

Polkadot -  Ethereum has such a tremendous infrastructure advantage vs. other Layer 1 projects. Polkadot and Cosmos hub-and-spoke models look very similar to eth2. There are numerous ways these ""ETH-Killer"" competitors might siphon value if ETH runs into a hiccup during the ETH2 rollout.

DeFi Pulse Index - gets me exposure to the top [11 Ethereum DeFi](https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi) projects by market cap (and some other metrics. Anthony Sassano explains it pretty well [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kRWP0TdzME). So I basically have exposure to UNI, AAVE, SNX, MKR, COMP, REN, YFI, LRC, BAL, KNC, and MTC by owning this DPI. Rebalances every few weeks.

Avalanche - Vitalik Buterin tweeted about Avalanche back in [February of 2020](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1229908044714086401?s=20) and in [May 2020](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1261626901438910464?s=20) which put it on my radar. I started doing research on it and finally bought my AVAX bags in December 2020. And holy hell did I pick a time to buy. I got lucky with timing (thanks Bulls), damn thing near exploded. 6% might be a little too much of an allocation for me honestly in this one.

Litecoin - I am not long LTC. I usually buy LTC at something like .004 BTC and then sell LTC at around .0045 BTC. I'm not a day trader, this is just something I've been following, I don't recommend it. Those aren't hard and fast numbers, just trying to get a about a 10%-12% BTC return on this from time to time by doing this. I don't hold LTC long-term.

ZCash - I love Zooko. I love this project, love Zero Knowledge Proofs, love shielded withdraws. Messari Crypto guys love this project, Winklevoss guys love this project. Go watch Zooko's explanation of [Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://youtu.be/3NL0ThdvWMU?t=275) on YouTube. He also has a presentation on the [history of Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV0Qw9-ukcg) that is pretty great. Lot's of love here....but only 3% allocation. Can't invest with your heart....I tell myself.

REEF - Started farming this when it was on Binance Launch Pool. Basically start-up vaporware right now, but building on DOT which I feel like is interesting (currently an ERC-20 Token until migration). Interesting to follow the roadmap. I do have some price projections on this project....but I'll keep those to myself out of fear of getting downvoted into oblivion. Also has good pairings on Binance.

Dust - Just for fun here's the dust: BCH, FIL, COMP, WOZX, LPT, CUSDC (thanks Coinbase), and ETHB. The BCH, LPT, and ETHB are just leftovers from 2017/18, but I still kinda like LPT a little. ETHB was a scam coin with a hilariously funny whitepaper...man was I dumb back then. I keep these EtherBTCs for 3 reasons (1) reminder to don't be dumb, (2) gas prices are too expensive to just get rid of them, and (3) kind of like keeping them in my ledger as a badge of honor for making all the way through the 2018-19 bear market.

Other Sectors I'm interested in for future investment:

Web3 applications - My next sector to invest in, but I'm just not quite there yet. And when I am, it will probably be Filecoin over The Graph and Chainlink (I know I know, everyone loves those) followed by Orchid (VPNs), Livepeer (video transcoding), and Helium (IoT device networks).",1614275867,goqbank

"ETH2 doesn't solve gas fees, for the 1000th time. All layer 1 blockchains with smart contracts that are sufficiently decentralized will always always have relatively high fees. The only way to get low fees and maintain decentralization is through layer 2 scaling

"People drop this quote, as if it's some type of ""gotcha"".

I hate high fees as much as anyone. I love Ethereum, but it's become unusable for me. But I know these problems will be solved.

The Ethereum community still believes 100% in the goal of low fees, and we're working hard to create scaling technology that will drive down costs.

Lots of this technology is here today: Loopring allows trading &amp; transferring for only a couple pennies in fees. Optimism just announced that it will launch on mainnet in a month, bringing low fees to more complex dapps. And Eth2's data availability will multiply these scaling benefits.

The only thing Ethereum isn't willing to sacrifice is decentralization. Yes, you can use Binance chain for a few pennies, but you can also use PayPal for no fee. If we give up decentralization, then what was the point of this whole thing?",1614264911,goplh18

"There was no matic hype when I looked into it at 0.03. And I think that rise in value was essentially unpredictable and is likely entirely driven by insider information.

From what I found at the time, projects were either implementing their own L2 solution(loopring), working on xdai or waiting for optimism. Nothing I found at the time pointed to matic being *the* L2 layer, if anything it was between xdai and optimism. Now xdai is not hot and nobody's talking about optimism, but if uni still goes to optimism instead of matic then I don't see how matic isn't overvalued. So maybe some people have insider information that uni is going to matic, which would rationalize the current price. But good luck predicting that.

"Never said eth doesn't have its share of problems, it does and I'm keeping my eye on the progress. 

What I disagree with is the notion that eth is legacy while cardano is next gen. That next gen thing is another marketing pearl. There isn't anything not already seen or tried in cardano. Comparing l2 to ""next gen"" is missing the point. Your next gen will require scaling solutions soon enough if adoption catches up with the hype. One doggy coin on cardano and you will scramble for l2 yourself. 

And for eth upgrade, that isn't the reason why the devs are rushing it. The reason is switching from pow to pos, that is the main motivator. Even when that happens late in the year or so, that won't help with the fees and scaling issues. And that was planned because scaling solutions(l2) are going live all over the place. 

You said that you used eth quite a bit.. well don't do uniswap on l1 if you aren't in a hurry. You could already try using polygon for swaps or maybe even loopring. In few months fees won't be an issue for most of people because they won't need to start on l1 at all.",1621664057,gz13wbp

"It's fine for a transaction of layer 1. People use Uniswap because they are lazy. Ethereum is permissionless and has a free market for gas. People pay what they are willing to pay, that's how it works. What do you think would happen to Cardano's gas prices if they blocks ever got full? 

You can use DYDX or Loopring or whatever is available on Matic or another L2 options if you want to make transactions for basically free. You don't have to pay obscene amounts of money to use Ethereum, people just keep doing it because they are lazy or ignorant.

It's true that migrating to layer 2 is a process, but it's something that's available today if you care that much about the fees.

"There already are several L2 solutions that you can use today with near zero or even zero fees. For instance Loopring, dYdX and Matic. It is still slightly more of a hassle than just using L1 as you have to bridge over your assets to the L2 (similar to doing a transaction) before you can use the L2, but I expect this to get better in the future as this will be fully integrated in the UI/UX of the different dapps. 

There are also many more L2s that are set to release in the coming months and many of the existing dapps are already integrating these solutions. The most well known one is Uniswap, which is set to release a L2 version on Optimism, likely within a few weeks. I think that will really show the general public the power of L2 solutions and that will likely kill the high fees narrative.",1620812988,gxu39gv

"You're certainly on the right track. It'll require some patience while the market figures out that rollups compete with and actually far, far superior to ""Eth killers"". 

Aztec is a great project, and are differentiating themselves by offering a ZK-ZK rollup with one ZK layer for privacy, the other for scalability. I haven't used Hermez, but I do know they are USDT's ""official"" rollup. BitFinex have added direct deposits/withdrawals to USDT on Hermez, but it's not going to go anywhere until other exchanges do the same. I don't know why they aren't, traders using L1 to move around USDT between CEXs is very inefficient - they should absolutely use some ZK rollup to do so (zkSync, Loopring Pay and Hermez all support USDT, USDC and DAI). However, if we see, say, Binance, Huobi or Coinbase also enable deposits/withdrawals directly to USDT on Hermez, it could be a pretty big player.",1620712231,gxp6o6f
"I've been reading everything I can on zkrollups ever since Vitalik basically said it's the way of the future on the Bankless podcast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcCHlqgGSH4 (good listen if you haven't heard it.)

I've played around with zkSync and like what they're doing there and they've said that a token is coming out. When I saw the backing they received it was pretty obvious to me that there was something good cooking. Aave, Balancer, Curve, 1Inch, Coinbase Ventures, Binance, Loopring, Placeholder, CoinGecko, Dragonfly Capital...Those are some heavy hitters..

StarkNet also seems pretty put together (maybe even moreso than zkSync) and the backing there is undeniable as well.. Pantera... Polychain, Vitalik?

Do you have opinions on on Aztec and Hermez? Vitalik also mentions them on the Ethereum website but I haven't been able to do a deep dive on them yet. 
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/

I'm an L2 user, but frankly I'm looking at these from more of an investment perspective. It's not everyday Vitalik outlines Ethereum's future and drops names of projects who are going to help achieve it. In my opionon, at least one or two of these projects will find massive success. I've dropped all the other research I've been doing to just learn as much as I about the L2 universe, I think it's an incredible opportunity.",1620710686,gxp4osr

but yeah this is a valid concern. it could be sometimes slow and steady wins the race, they are putting their resources and effort into the product, not into hype. it could also be they create a fantastic technical product, but nobody knows about it and it dies, this happens all the time and is not exclusive to crypto

maybe pose these questions on their reddit / telegram / where ever and see what response you get. all projects are in stealth mode at some point, and this is how you pick up bargains as once everyone knows about it then the price goes up and its no longer an entry point.

what does your gut tell you? do you think they'll actually be able to gain that hype and traction? if the answer is not either a yes, or a strong maybe, then perhaps this isn't a good project.

I feel like this about LoopRing / LRC. great project, already has layer 2 with ZK rollups. Its basically Uniswap but without the high transaction fees. Unfortunately there are limited pairs to swap, and nobody seems to be using it or talking about it, UNI gets all the hype due to the governance airdrop, etc. Will it do well, probably, will it become the most used DEX? probably not. and that is mostly down to lack of hype and community",1620204174,gx07mc7
"The data is still stored on chain in a rollup, the scaling factor is how much the data of L2 transactions can be compressed before being finalised in L1 such that users can withdraw from the rollup if the relayer vanishes. All you have to do to see the scaling factor of 1000x for transfers is look at the size of data required for L1 transactions relative to the share 1 tx takes up inside a tx of loopring settling on chain tx.

Loopring requires jumping through loop*holes* that a user shouldn’t have to do if Ethereum had a network effect. Scalability is an issue that ethereum doesn’t have a proper solution for until ETH 2.0. Don’t count your chickens before they’re hatched. 

[*The network effect is a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value of a good or service. The Internet is an example of the network effect. Initially, there were few users on the Internet since it was of little value to anyone outside of the military and some research scientists.*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-effect.asp)",1600405338,g5oa0oc

They also must have had tooling for deposits, vaults, etc. The whole thing was put together in 10 days and then look how quickly everything else sprung up. 

Yes, the gas prices of defi are off putting... but we are in an awkward time here waiting on eth 2.0. There are possible ways to solve the congestion issues, for example loopring can now host AMMs (Uniswap and clones) so users just enter once and can trade for no fees while on the loopring chain. It's anchored to the ethereum chain and supposedly secure. 

Fees to miners on Uniswap actually surpassed the entirety of the bitcoin network. If these gas fees were removed, overall gas would go down significantly. And if other major dapps started jumping in the same sidechains, then there is less reason for users to withdraw. It could just be a ""defi"" sidechain of ethereum or something. And hopefully with eth2.0, this is all even better.

Anyway, Network effects are all the previous tools built for that blockchain that new teams can leverage on, and for one team to be able to piggy back off the protocol of another, etc etc.",1600404669,g5o94jq

Right now, Loopring is strictly an order book exchange which has its advantages and disadvantages. For a small trader who likes low market cap coins it’s a disadvantage. For high volume trading its an advantage. 

The biggest problem is that even if there was an L2 uniswap clone, you’d have to have the liquidity to make it worth it. Would be kinda tough to move all the money on uniswap right now to an L2 swap exchange.

It does not support smart contract transactions and focuses on simple transactions, leaving those types of transactions to other L2 solutions. Some large exchanges are moving onto the OMG network, specifically their tether which supports the ecosystem.

Loopring, zk rollups &amp; matic? Are the other sidechain L2's that are ways to reduce ethereum fees although im not as well versed in them.

Polygon (side chain and not a layer 2)

- Solve chain bloat by introducing a multichain data availability layer. 
- Want to be the Cosmos for Ethereum (multichain eco-system that connects to Ethereum).
- Working on their own optimistic and zk rollup layer 2 solutions

Layer 2
Optimistic rollups: Arbitrum and Optimism are racing for first to market
Zkrollups: zksync and starkware are leading this space. starkware also are not EVM and utilize their own virtual machines (I think it's good to diversify to de-risk)
Loopring: has zkrollups already on their exchange and are working on a solution which can move funds from rollup to rollup. 

Whatever the case they are trying to solve different issues and at the base layer even with POS and sharding you'll still have problems with throughput so layer 2s are very necessary. 

You also see orgs like E&amp;Y build their own layer 2s. At the end of the day a layer 2 is basically a way to own your own computing hardware to bundle and settle transactions on Ethereum using proofs. I believe you'll see more companies building their own layer 2s.",1626969759,h6525kd

"Disclosure: I own ETH

Ethereum's network effects as the dominant smart contract platform are overwhelming:

* Ethereum's momentum as the primary platform where crypto-assets are issued has grown over the last three years, with the share of the total token market cap constituted by Ethereum based tokens rising from 73.81% in July 2017, to 98.40% in July 2020 [(source)](https://medium.com/@amincad/ethereum-achieves-absolute-dominance-of-token-market-f7ef9c26ede). The entire market has steadily converged on Ethereum as the settlement layer for crypto-assets and Ethereum's ERC20 token interface as its technology standard for digital assets.
* Ethereum is the most utilized crypto platform in the world, with more fees being paid to Ethereum miners than any other project's. The dominance extends beyond just Ethereum, to Ethereum-based dApps, with nine of the next ten largest revenue earning crypto projects in the world being based on Ethereum, as this charts shows with all the projects highlighted in pink being Ethereum-based: [https://cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)
* Almost all DeFi applications operate on Ethereum, with [97 of the top 98 DeFi projects tracked by DefiPulse](https://defipulse.com/) being Ethereum-based. These DeFi apps are all interacting to create an increasingly sophisticated open financial system on Ethereum that gives the platform an increasingly insurmountable advantage over potential competitors.
* All of the major stablecoins; Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), True USD (TUSD), Binance USD (BUSD), and Paxos Standard (PAX), use the ERC20 standard.
* The top three cryptocurrency exchanges in the world by trade volume, Binance, Huobi and OkEx, have all launched [(source)](https://www.hecochain.com/en-us/) or are launching [(source)](https://www.okex.com/okexchain) permissioned instances of Ethereum, establishing the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Ethereum-based wallets like MetaMask as the technology standard of and the primary gateway to the emerging digital asset sector, respectively.

Beyond market adoption, the Ethereum development community is by far the largest in the cryptocurrency space, and its advantage over all other smart contract platforms has rapidly grown over the last three years:

* Ethereum has an overwhelming lead over all other cryptocurrency and blockchain projects in the number of developers working on it according to the recently released [Electric Capital Developer Report (2020)](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444). This lead is accelerating, with a 215% increase in the number of developers working on Ethereum since 2017, and with the number of monthly developers increasing by 300+ between Q3 2019 and Q3 2020, which bucked the downward trend seen in the rest of the cryptocurrency market. [(source)](https://i.imgur.com/Hfo9rTP.jpg)
* The overwhelming majority of Research and Development on blockchain scalability is being done on Ethereum-based projects [(source)](https://github.com/Awesome-Layer-2/awesome-layer-2). Groundbreaking scalability solutions that have recently launched on Ethereum Mainnet include Loopring and zkSync, which use zkRollUp technology to enable thousands of transactions per second to be processed on Ethereum layer 1: [(source)](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum-770d35213408)",1626233173,h545rmi

"Pasting this here:

 I've seen  a little bit of this commentary recently, so i'll try to address it in a single post for clarity. Please pay it forward by educating others when you can.

Mostly it refers to the question of ""Does Ethereum launching EIP-1559/Improving their scaling/the launch of Optimism compromise the goals of Polygon?"":


1.	⁠What is Ethereum 2.0? Despite conjecture, the Eth2 roadmap is already significantly complete. There is no “launch of Ethereum 2.0” as a milestone. The beacon chain has been launched (http://beaconcha.in) since December. The next milestones remain to complete ""The Merge"" of both chains into a single Proof of Stake instance (http://ethmerge.com), and then to complete Data Sharding later. There's a lot more complex research to it, but that's the most important. These milestones improve the utillity of the base Layer (see more later), but don't increase TPS by any orders of magnitude. The complicated computational sharding that people continue to refer to as ""Ethereum 2.0"" is not happening. This is a good thing, it was always a difficult endeavour and priorities change. So how does Ethereum scale without computational sharding?
2.	⁠Polygon is Ethereum 2.0 - Alongside Loopring, Optimism, ZkSnarks, ImmutableX etc, Layer 2 is the future architecture of Ethereum. You can read more here: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698 Ultimately, we are going to need all of these experiments and maybe more, and hopefully multiple technologies become viable and provide separate cost/time/security trade-offs for different dApps. For example, ImmutableX is laser focused on gaming NFTs. The only difference is that Polygon is taking a multi-technology approach, rather than a narrow single technology approach. This is ambitous, but they intend to offer all of these options under a single umbrella. As we move to an inter-chain world, this will hopefully pay off in terms of User Experience. But they will need to work closely with other teams to get this done, and that is what they're doing.
3.	⁠EIP-1559 supports this vision - in this world, we need a reliable Layer 1, where roll-ups and sidechains that Polygon deploy can be consistenly and regularly checkpointed to the base chain. Gas will likely remain high on Ethereum due to roll-up demand, so EIP-1559 and Data Sharding are important projects to supercharge the base layer. While they won't give it magical scaling powers to reduce gas to zero, they will make it much more functional in a multi-roll-up world.
4.	⁠Demand vs Supply - This is the classic, nobody goes there it's too crowded scenario. While it might feel like these projects are competing to provide supply, the correct way to think about it is that they are working together to ensure demand. And right now demand is far outstripping supply. While this causes the chaos of high gas, it's super healthy for the network and smart people are working very hard to build into it and overcome it. It could get messy with liquidity mining and incentive wars to bring dApps and developers into each L2 stack, but ultimately - the goal is to scale Ethereum so that people continue to want to use it - and that goal is synergistic.
5.	⁠A multi-chain future - So yes, we're going to have multiple competing technologies, but we'll likely have teams working together, mergers and lots of fun to come, but the Polygon vision to combine these all under one roof makes them both a unique and an exciting prospect and an important part of the Ethereum community. Hopefully we can avoid as much bitterness and uncertainty as possible (and there will be others trying to stoke this doubt), so it's important we keep these values in mind and build towards a harmonious multi-chain future.

I hope that helps! :)",1623502358,h1ieyid
"They might as well stop pretending Bitcoin is a utility network and just exchange it on their own networks like PayPal and visa are doing.

Vitalik Buterin Talks About Dogecoin and Ethereum Bridge, Elon Musk Agrees


Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin talked about a potential collaboration between Ethereum and Dogecoin in an interview with AI researcher Lex Fridman last week.
Referring to the Tesla and Spacex CEO repeatedly tweeting about dogecoin, Fridman said, “There’s a power behind someone like Elon Musk pushing the development of a cryptocurrency.” He then asked Buterin, “is there a way to leverage that power and momentum to improve Ethereum?” Buterin said:


If DOGE wants to somehow bridge to Ethereum, and then people can trade DOGE thousands of times a second inside of loopring, then that would be amazing.",1623343257,h1ar3rt
"I haven't seen any evidence that Cardano will be significantly more scalable than Ethereum.

They've certainly made some marginal improvements, but blockchains need order-of-magnitude improvements to reach widespread usage. Many of their scalability claims come from Hydra, a state channel system, but so far state channels haven't been very successful on Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Personally, I'm much more excited about rollups on Ethereum. I already use Loopring for trading and paying friends, which is just a couple pennies per transaction. And I've also gotten permission to play with Arbitrum, which is a game-changer for Ethereum, and should be launching to the public with apps like Uniswap in the next week or two.",1623334801,h1a6nhs

"It’s a semantic spectrum between a “Layer 2” (PayPal is a Layer 2 for your bank account), and a theoretical “L2” or “roll-up” that inherits the full security of the underlying Layer 1.

In reality everything sits somewhere in between with tradeoffs on speed, usability and cost.

The defining point in the Layer 2 vs L2 semantic arguments seems to be that for an L2, even if the network security is compromised, you can always exit your assets to Layer 1. But hey, aside from Loopring and ImmutableX they’re not fully live yet and sidechains are - so use Polygon PoS and xDAI and don’t feel guilty about it! 😅",1623293309,h18ho9u
"I disagree with that take. Very few Cryptocurrencies are competing to become an everyday payment mechanism, especially not at Layer 1. Nano might be one of the few exceptions where this remains a specific priority.

These scenarios will definitely need to exist on Layer 2 rather than Layer 1 - ie. Loopring and Lightning network.",1623066256,h0wd0u6

Loopring,1634255044,hgo9skz
"**Taken from u/maleficent_plankton's submission from last round**

**Gas Fees**:

The biggest issues for Ethereum are its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it's the reason small ERC20 transactions on DeFi platforms under $1000 are impractical. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it's often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin's native network, and then trade back into the original token. Pretty ridiculous.

[Typical transaction fees were between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $70 on several occasions. It's very common for popular exchanges to set withdrawal fees to a flat $20-50 for ERC20 transfers due to expensive and unpredictable Ethereum network fees.

And that's just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees in early 2021 probably saw $100-$200 gas fees. Staking MATIC also costs expensive ERC20 gas fees. (So much for MATIC's claim to reduce ETH gas fees.)

**Inflation**:

Ethereum has no supply limit and is still inflationary. It did have [three deflationary days](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/on-chain-metrics/ethereum/net-eth-emission-after-eip-1559) in September 2021 after EIP-1557, but it's still net inflationary of ~5K ETH daily. As other competitors join the smart contract space, it's likely we'll see fewer deflationary days in the future.

**Smart Contract Competition**:

Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain because it had so few competitors historically. Now we have tons of efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. While Ethereum has an enormous lead in smart contract project adoption, it is likely to gradually lose market share to its competitors, which are ahead of it in terms of efficiency and technology. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano? This will mainly depend on whether the PoS consensus Ethereum 2.0 can arrive fast enough, and whether it can deliver its claims. For now, we are stuck with PoW Ethereum with almost no adoption for Layer 2.

**Layer 2 issues**:

Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early and almost have no adoption. Considering how long it takes exchanges to roll out Layer 2 networks, it'll probably be 6-12 months before I can use any Ethereum Layer 2 solutions on Coinbase. (Polygon network still isn't available on any of the biggest US exchanges after half a year of becoming popular and claiming hundreds of partnerships). The majority of platforms do not currently support Layer 2 rollup networks. Very few fiat onramping/offramping exchanges allow for Optimistic or zk-Rollups. ZK Rollups are very limited in use until they have coordination between exchanges that both support them.

**L2 - Plasma** has been around since 2017, and I couldn't find anyone still using this state-channel solution. It's [more or less abandoned](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/the-life-and-death-of-plasma-b72c6a59c5ad) in favor of rollups. I guess some Polygon bridges still use Plasma. It required lots of work and always-online overhead to monitor the side chain for misbehavior. You also need to pay the ERC20 gas fee twice when opening and closing the state channel. It has all the downsides to Lightning, which itself is facing lack of adoption. There is a super long challenge period to exit a side chain via Plasma, which means a 1 week settlement. And a mass exit would complete congest the Ethereum blockchain. 

Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs.

**L2 - Optimistic Rollups are expensive and slow**:

They settle in [1 week](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) because there is a challenge period where anyone can submit a fraud-proof to show if there was an illegitimate transaction. People get anxious over 30-minute finality. How are they going to deal with 1 week settlement? Also, optimistic rollups are inherently insecure by design in order to reduce fees because they outsource validation offchain. The operator can influence transaction ordering. You can have faster withdrawals if you pay a market maker or verifier to jump in and swap your transaction, but why bother with the additional hassle and fees? I don't think the average crypto user will have any use cases for optimistic rollups. Optimistic rollups currently cost [$1-2 on Arbitrum One and Optimism](https://l2fees.info/). Unless you need to use a smart contract (which aren't supported on ZK Rollups), why would anyone anyone want to babysit their transactions for 1 week when ZK Rollups are faster, cheaper, and more secure?

**L2 - ZK Rollup limitations**:

ZK Rollup require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive (potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly). On-chain cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.20 to $.40](https://l2fees.info/), but there is a separate infrastructure cost that is rarely mentioned. Loopring is rolling up its costs into its trading fees, currently 0.80%, so their feeless transfer claims are misleading. For transfers of $10K, that's $80 of fees. In any case, even at $0.40, these are still ~100x more expensive than transferring microtransaction-friendly coins such as XLM, XRP, Nano, etc. FWIW, it's a huge improvement over current Layer 1 costs ... when the platforms I use support them some year in the future. The big limitation is that smart contracts can't use ZK Rollups.

**Ethereum 2.0 arriving later than competitors**:

Ethereum is separated into Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) and Casper CBC (Correct by Construction). Casper FFG is a BFT PoS consensus overlay of PoW based on the GHOST protocol. We don't have much details on Casper CBC since its design is still in progress. Its main purpose is to increase transaction speeds and reduce energy costs while sacrificing decentralization and security.

The ETH 2.0 Beacon chain, a completely separate blockchain from ETH, won't merge with the main blockchain [until 2022](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving competitors plenty of time to steal a share of smart contract projects. Even then, Vitalik said that [scaling will still rely on ZK Rollups until the 64-chain sharding phase](https://decrypt.co/34204/ethereum-2-0-will-walk-and-roll-for-two-years-before-it-can-run) arriving later in 2022 or 2023. It'll likely lose some market share to existing alternatives like Algo, Solana, Cardano, and others.

Unlike Cardano PoS staking, Ethereum 2.0 PoS staking uses slashing. The system cannot tell between being offline or being censored. It's pretty damn scary.
50% downtime is breakeven (unless there's no prepare + commit). Slash punishment can be very harsh. In the first months, we already had multiple examples of large slashings on the Beacon ETH 2.0 chain caused by simple errors: [Bugs](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a) can cause slashing.

Disclosure: I own ETH

Ethereum's network effects as the dominant smart contract platform are overwhelming:

* Ethereum's momentum as the primary platform where crypto-assets are issued has grown over the last three years, with the share of the total token market cap constituted by Ethereum based tokens rising from 73.81% in July 2017, to 98.40% in July 2020 [(source)](https://medium.com/@amincad/ethereum-achieves-absolute-dominance-of-token-market-f7ef9c26ede). The entire market has steadily converged on Ethereum as the settlement layer for crypto-assets and Ethereum's ERC20 token interface as its technology standard for digital assets.
* Ethereum is the most utilized crypto platform in the world, with more fees being paid to Ethereum miners than any other project's. The dominance extends beyond just Ethereum, to Ethereum-based dApps, with nine of the next ten largest revenue earning crypto projects in the world being based on Ethereum, as this charts shows with all the projects highlighted in pink being Ethereum-based: [https://cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)
* Almost all DeFi applications operate on Ethereum, with [97 of the top 98 DeFi projects tracked by DefiPulse](https://defipulse.com/) being Ethereum-based. These DeFi apps are all interacting to create an increasingly sophisticated open financial system on Ethereum that gives the platform an increasingly insurmountable advantage over potential competitors.
* All of the major stablecoins; Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), True USD (TUSD), Binance USD (BUSD), and Paxos Standard (PAX), use the ERC20 standard.
* The top three cryptocurrency exchanges in the world by trade volume, Binance, Huobi and OkEx, have all launched [(source)](https://www.hecochain.com/en-us/) or are launching [(source)](https://www.okex.com/okexchain) permissioned instances of Ethereum, establishing the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Ethereum-based wallets like MetaMask as the technology standard of and the primary gateway to the emerging digital asset sector, respectively.

Beyond market adoption, the Ethereum development community is by far the largest in the cryptocurrency space, and its advantage over all other smart contract platforms has rapidly grown over the last three years:

* Ethereum has an overwhelming lead over all other cryptocurrency and blockchain projects in the number of developers working on it according to the recently released [Electric Capital Developer Report (2020)](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444). This lead is accelerating, with a 215% increase in the number of developers working on Ethereum since 2017, and with the number of monthly developers increasing by 300+ between Q3 2019 and Q3 2020, which bucked the downward trend seen in the rest of the cryptocurrency market. [(source)](https://i.imgur.com/Hfo9rTP.jpg)
* The overwhelming majority of Research and Development on blockchain scalability is being done on Ethereum-based projects [(source)](https://github.com/Awesome-Layer-2/awesome-layer-2). Groundbreaking scalability solutions that have recently launched on Ethereum Mainnet include Loopring and zkSync, which use zkRollUp technology to enable thousands of transactions per second to be processed on Ethereum layer 1: [(source)](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum-770d35213408)",1634254661,hgo8zhp

LOOPRING,1632974224,het7sco
"Guys what You think about LOOPRING (LRC) , anyone bet on this?",1632971430,het2s9d
"**Gas Fees**:

The biggest issues for Ethereum are its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. They often change 2-5x in price within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it's the reason small ERC20 transactions on DeFi platforms under $1000 are impractical.

[Typical transaction fees were between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $70 on several occassions. It's very common for popular exchanges to set withdrawal fees to a flat $20-50 for ERC20 transfers due to expensive and unpredictable Ethereum network fees.

**Inflation**:

Ethereum has no supply limit and is still inflationary. It did have [three deflationary days](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/on-chain-metrics/ethereum/net-eth-emission-after-eip-1559) in September 2021 after EIP-1557, but it's still net inflationary of ~5K ETH daily. As other competitors join the smart contract space, it's likely we'll see fewer deflationary days in the future.

**Smart Contract Competition**:

Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain because it had so few competitors historically. Now we have tons of efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. While Ethereum has an enormous lead in smart contract project adoption, it is likely to gradually lose market share to its competitors, which are ahead of it in terms of efficiency and technology. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano? This will mainly depend on whether the PoS consensus Ethereum 2.0 can arrive fast enough, and whether it can deliver its claims. For now, we are stuck with PoW Ethereum with almost no adoption for Layer 2.

**Layer 2 issues**:

Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early and almost have no adoption. Considering how long it takes exchanges to roll out Layer 2 networks, it'll probably be 6-12 months before I can use any Ethereum Layer 2 solutions on Coinbase. (Polygon network still isn't available on any of the biggest US exchanges after half a year of becoming popular and claiming hundreds of partnerships). The majority of platforms do not currently support Layer 2 rollup networks. Very few fiat onramping/offramping exchanges allow for Optimistic or zk-Rollups. ZK Rollups are very limited in use until they have coordination between exchanges that both support them.

**L2 - Plasma** has been around since 2017, and I couldn't find anyone still using this state-channel solution. It's [more or less abandoned](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/the-life-and-death-of-plasma-b72c6a59c5ad) in favor of rollups. It required lots of work and always-online overhead to monitor the side chain for misbehavior. There is a super long challenge period to exit a side chain via Plasma, which can take up to 1 week. And a mass exit would complete congest the Ethereum blockchain. It has all the downsides to Lightning, which itself is facing lack of adoption.

Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs.

**L2 - Optimistic Rollups are expensive and slow**:

They settle in [1 week](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) because there is a challenge period where anyone can submit a fraud-proof to show if there was an illegitimate transaction. People get anxious over 30-minute finality. How are they going to deal with 1 week settlement? Also, optimistic rollups are inherently insecure by design in order to reduce fees since they outsource validation offchain. The operator can influence transaction ordering. You can have faster withdrawals if you pay a market maker or verifier to jump in and swap your transaction, but why bother with the additional hassle and fees? I don't think the average crypto user will have any use cases for optimistic rollups. Optimistic rollups currently cost [$1-2 on Arbitrum One and Optimism](https://l2fees.info/). Why would anyone anyone want to babysit their transactions for 1 week when ZK Rollups are faster, cheaper, and more secure?

**L2 - ZK Rollup limitations**:

ZK Rollup require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive (potentialy [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly). On-chain cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.20 to $.40](https://l2fees.info/), but there is a separate infrastructure cost that is rarely mentioned. Loopring is rolling up its costs into its trading fees, currently 0.80%, so their feeless transfer claims are misleading. For transfers of $10K, that's $80 of fees. In any case, even at $0.40, these are still ~100x more expensive than transferring microtransaction-friendly coins such as XLM, XRP, Nano, etc. FWIW, it's a huge improvement over current Layer 1 costs ... when the platforms I use support them some year in the future.

**Ethereum 2.0 arriving later than competitors**:

Ethereum is separated into Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) and Casper CBC (Correct by Construction). Casper FFG is a BFT PoS consensus overlay of PoW based on the GHOST protocol. We don't have much details on Casper CBC since its design is still in progress. Its main purpose is to increase transaction speeds and reduce energy costs while sacrificing decentralization and security.

The ETH 2.0 Beacon chain, a completely separate blockchain from ETH, won't merge with the main blockchain [until 2022](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving competitors plenty of time to steal a share of smart contract projects. Even then, Vitalik said that [scaling will still rely on ZK Rollups until the 64-chain sharding phase](https://decrypt.co/34204/ethereum-2-0-will-walk-and-roll-for-two-years-before-it-can-run) arriving later in 2022 or 2023. It'll likely lose some market share to existing alternatives like Algo, Solana, Cardano, and others.

Unlike Cardano PoS staking, Ethereum 2.0 PoS staking uses slashing. The system cannot tell between being offline or being censored. It's pretty damn scary.
50% downtime is breakeven (unless there's no prepare + commit). Slash punishment can be very harsh. In the first months, we already had multiple examples of large slashings on the Beacon ETH 2.0 chain caused by simple errors: [Bugs](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a) can cause slashing. [Timestamp](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a) being off and cause slashing.

"Loopring is an open protocol for building decentralized exchanges. Loopring operates as a public set of smart
contracts responsible for trade and settlement, with an off-chain group of actors aggregating and communicating orders.The protocol is free, extensible, and serves as a standardized building block for decentralized applications (dApps) that incorporate exchange functionality. Its interoperable standards facilitate trustless, anonymous trading. An important
improvement over current decentralized exchange protocols is the ability for orders to be mix-and-matched with other, dissimilar orders, obviating the constraints of two-token trading pairs and drastically improving liquidity. Loopring also employs a unique and robust solution to prevent front-running: the unfair attempt to submit transactions into a block quicker than the original solution provider. Loopring is blockchain agnostic, and deployable on any blockchain
with smart contract functionality. At the time of writing, it’s operable on Ethereum [1] [2] and Qtum [3] with NEO [4] under construction.",1640947870,hqo35h8

The smart contract platform with the most current adoption, most developers, most users, most outside investment, most traditional payment rail adoption via PayPal and crypto ATMs, and most institutional interest, produces additional tools that abstract away L2 technicalities to its users....

OR

nano gets more adopted over something that is just as fast, more configurable, more distributed, more private via the ZK technology you just witnessed, and more stable and familiar with the ability to use fiat tokens from the users home country?

We’ve been trying to tell you for years that this would happen. Here’s your first glimpse of ETH directly competent with nano.

To answer your question, loopring is the main relayer that acts as a method of batching transactions through a Merkle tree. Anyone can technically be a relayer.

"Copy/pasting /u/Qwahzi comment:

I just tried Loopring and it's pretty awesome, but it's not quite the same as Nano.

1. Loopring isn't really feeless, they're just subsidizing the transaction fees for now: ""The Loopring protocol requires us to process every user request, including account registration, account-key-reset, deposits, and withdrawals. We charge fees to cover Zero-Knowledge proof cost and Ethereum transaction gas fee, and also to avoid Sybil attack.""

2. You're still reliant on 1st layer Ethereum fees and conf times if you want to onboard/offboard your Loopring ETH or ERC20s for storage or to use with 1st layer services that haven't implemented Loopring

3. Loopring v3 offers the same level of security as Eth IF On-Chain Data Availability (OCDA) is turned on (depends on the service's implementation of the Loopring protocol). Turning that on reduces scalability a little bit (still really high, so not a big worry), but without it you're relying on a 3rd party to keep some of the data. Meaning that in an extreme case a government could shutdown that service. So, make sure the Loopring services you're using have OCDA enabled

4. Exchanges, wallets, and DEXs have to integrate Loopring tech

5. Loopring DEXs don't automatically support all ERC20s, there's some integration work that has to be done

6. Loopring Pay transfers happen on their zkRollup, meaning the recipient must also be on it (have to register first)

7. The code for layer 2 solutions like Loopring can be quite complex, and complexity can lead to security risks and other unforeseen issues",1606638133,gdzz8ms
"https://techblogwriter.libsyn.com/873-loopring

This is a really good podcast that goes through a lot of the technicals. 

But essentially its a method that allows you to batch transactions off chain and then use parts of the batch to write and verify proof of transactions on chain - Ethereum in this case.",1606621382,gdz1lcd
"Loopring Pay is great. In their latest version (3.6) they have enabled transfers to *any* ETH wallet, in the past you needed to deposit some ETH and create a L2 account.

They also offer a full L2 exchange, which is a nice (and cheaper) alternative to Uniswap. Only issue is low liquidity.",1606619585,gdyxtw4
"For all the people who say ethereum does not scale: there are already solutions with theoretically up to 2500tps running on Ethereum, on layer 2! One of them is loopring. They have been running a layer 2 dex for about a year already. They have a mobile l2 wallet, and are soon coming out with a layer 2 automated market maker (amm) similar to uniswap. So Ethereum does scale!",1606582830,gdw3w0f
"Obviously everyone wants fast, free payment transactions. But personally, I think that will come through rollups, not a new blockchain.

Ethereum has seen incredible growth in L2 rollups in the past year. Some (Loopring, ZKsync) have already launched, and others will be launching within the next few months.

Like Nano, they give:

* Almost free transactions (pay a fraction of a penny)
* High scalability (thousands of tps)
* Instant confirmation times*

Unlike Nano, they also give:

* Access to any token (ETH, WBTC) including stablecoins (Dai, USDT, USDC)
* The security of the L1 chain (Ethereum is the 2nd most secure chain)
* DEX trading
* Smart contracts (on optimistic rollups)
* An existing ecosystem (it's much easier to get Ethereum users to use a L2 than switch to a new blockchain)

Nano is definitely a cool project, but I can't see it outcompeting these scalability solutions.",1606562984,gduy80h

Now has Ben Golub at the helm (CEO that took Docker from nothing to what it is) and former CIO of NextDC Brian Lillie now an advisor on the project. They have a solid team and would be surprised if this does not evolve to high levels of adoption.

"I mostly agree with you, but I'd argue that Nano's advantage is not just the tech, but also its simplicity.

It's basically the same problem LN has, but not quite as bad

"Have you tried Loopring for yourself? It's good for Ethereum (and cryptocurrency as a whole), but it isn't really a competitor to Nano. Different goals, different purposes, and different pros/cons:

1. Loopring isn't really feeless, they're just subsidizing the transaction fees for now: ""The Loopring protocol requires us to process every user request, including account registration, account-key-reset, deposits, and withdrawals. We charge fees to cover Zero-Knowledge proof cost and Ethereum transaction gas fee, and also to avoid Sybil attack.""

2. You're still reliant on 1st layer Ethereum fees and conf times if you want to onboard/offboard your Loopring ETH or ERC20s for storage or to use with 1st layer services that haven't implemented Loopring

3. Loopring v3 offers the same level of security as Eth IF On-Chain Data Availability (OCDA) is turned on (depends on the service's implementation of the Loopring protocol). Turning that on reduces scalability a little bit (still really high, so not a big worry), but without it you're relying on a 3rd party to keep some of the data. Meaning that in an extreme case a government could shutdown that service. So, make sure the Loopring services you're using have OCDA enabled

4. Exchanges, wallets, and DEXs have to integrate Loopring tech

5. Loopring DEXs don't automatically support all ERC20s, there's some integration work that has to be done

6. Loopring Pay transfers happen on their zkRollup, meaning the recipient must also be on it (have to register first)

7. Your funds can be locked up for 24 hours if the Loopring service you're using goes down

8. Individual Loopring services could censor your Loopring transactions, potentially forcing you to exit the contract",1591730540,fti9mzw

"Well if you accept erc20, you accept like 80 percent of the top 100 crypto’s. You can even accept wbtc to have btc exposure without the high fees. I no longer like owning bitcoin on my hardware wallet since in 2017 I was burned hard. Tried to move bitcoin from trezor to exchange, paid 75 dollar fee and didn’t show up until 30 hours later. Was too late then. So I just ate another fee (though smaller) to move it back. Also I can trade for wbtc on decentralized exchanges so I’ll never have to use an actual exchange. Try using the ethereum ecosystem and it’s really hard to use other crypto’s. I don’t intend to be a maximalist but if you trend towards ease of use and adoption, it’s all on ethereum. 

Let’s say you’re a new company and you create an erc20 you want to use for payments. Voila! Already all these vending machines can accept. 

Let’s say you create a new token that’s on a stand-alone blockchain. How the hell is anyone going to accept your payment? Will you ever catch up to something that accepts erc20?

In fact, when binance became binance.us was the last time I used an centralized exchange.

"Yes, that's true. There are differences like the number of confirmations to get your transaction processed. That matters a lot to the retail experience and to me as well. There's a big difference between instantly, definitively confirmed transactions in under 1 second, and say a feeless 10 to 30 second transaction as well. That is why a payments processing company like Kappture chose to exclusively integrate Nano into their POS systems:

https://dailyhodl.com/2019/06/21/nano-to-be-exclusively-integrated-into-kappture-electronic-point-of-sale-devices/

https://www.kappture.co.uk/files/accepting-cryptocurrency-at-the-point-of-sale.pdf
(see page 5 comparing multiple cryptocurrencies)

However, one reason I set aside a portion of my portfolio as Nano is because I recognize that the zero-inflation, zero fee protocol may allow for an extreme degree of novel developments and have a greater potential for growth in the future.  As with all crypto, no one knows the future.  All I know is that I want it to be FREE.

Perhaps I am illogically dreaming of a time when NFC crypto subway payments become a thing, and a simple swipe of a mobile phone becomes a standard thing.  It's possible with Nano.  Real-time micro transactions and private room tipping with no confirmations - possible too. Or, standing in front of a fiat dispensing machine as a tourist, choosing Nano as a fast, free option to buy local fiat. That company will have to be more transparent with their mark-up and will have no room to charge a ""network fee"".

If you check this thread, it's apparent to all what the value of feeless is. One guy even commented that he'd sell all his Nano if everything is comparable on the other side, because there's the potential for feeless transactions in the Ethereum ecosystem forever. That means value transfer and smart contract execution without fees! Of course it's not possible for that to be the case though.

But I'm not here to try to sell you into Nano.... if you see no value, I don't want to be the one to try to even convince you otherwise.  You already owned Nano once. If as you stated, feeless transactions in Loopring are what convinced you to sell all your Nano, then surely you yourself realize the value of a protocol being feeless.

Here's some more from a comment in the r/EthFinance daily yesterday: (https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gy740x/daily_general_discussion_june_7_2020/ft9plxz/)

    Loopring - uses ZK rollups to batch transactions and publishes proof of batch's validity and transaction data on chain. This allows a boost in throughput (~1,000-2,000 TPS), and you absolutely never need to trust Loopring. This architecture is best suited for unstoppable DEX's.
    DeversiFi, the new Starkware-powered DEX - uses ZK rollups to batch transactions, but only publishes proof of batch's validity on chain. Transaction data is kept off chain. People have been referring to this as Validium. This allows for a big boost in throughput (~10,000 TPS) and also keeps users trades private. The trade off is that if the data notaries want to freeze users' funds, they can easily do so by refusing to provide data to these users. There is no mechanism for users to prevent this. So this architecture is best suited for applications like gaming where trust assumptions are lower, or for centralized exchanges looking to offload their custody and transactional liability to Ethereum.
    Synthetix L2 (demo) - uses optimistic rollups. You'll notice [1] and [2] are applications that only involve asset transfers. This is because the ZK proofs they use to compress transactions essentially only support signatures. Smart contract logic cannot (yet) be batched using a zero knowledge proof. For an application like Synthetix, every time you trade one synth for another you are re-pricing debt (peer-to-contract) which is done through smart contract operations. With optimistic rollups, smart contract operations are bundled together by bonded block proposers. If you try to propose invalid operations, you will be caught and your bond will be forfeited. The process of proving malicious activity requires a fraud proof to be submitted on-chain, which are very expensive/slow and require multiple Ethereum blocks. So there can be a significant delay in retrieving funds from an OR contract.",1591598152,ftcglmi
"Currently there is only one relayer, but yes, people need to be aware of the relayers, because they send their transactions to the relayers. 

The mechanism is a purely economic one. The more transactions are combined, the cheaper costs for publishing become for each transactions that's included in the rollup. 
Time between transaction and update on the chain should also be kept low, so that users can exit without much delay. (I don't know how this is handled currently)

You are correct, that if Loopring were to set a fee, they could just wait until they have enough transactions to recoup the cost for publishing to the main chain.",1591591395,ftc80y9
"Hi Matt, thanks for taking your time to write out all this.

One question that arose in /r/ethfinance is, how are records of ""internal"" transactions maintained?

"Hey all. Matt here from Loopring team.

Thanks u/unknownessence for sharing the knowledge - so appreciated! And thanks everyone for the warm welcome (and especially thanks if you tried it out :).

I will try to quickly answer the questions I saw come up most in the comments:  


\--&gt; Is it only free for now / can we implement a fee?  

Yes. Settling txs to Ethereum using our zkRollup is so very cheap (\~1000x less than Ethereum layer 1 settlement cost) that a Relayer (aka an operator or backend) can realistically subsidize this for a very, very long time. Specifically, our optimized Relayer can settle 1 million TRADES for \~$124, or 1 million TRANSFERS (payments) for \~$60. So that cost is $0.00006 per transfer. We are happy to cover that cost right now to spread the love and bring on users to Ethereum's most secure scalability solution :). At some point we will implement fees. Certainly sooner if a spammer tries to make a million transfers to mess with us and fill up our zkRollup blocks :). If we do institute a fee to fight spammers, it may be as low as $0.0001. 

For a deep technical breakdown of these costs, [read this](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/zksnark-prover-optimizations-3e9a3e5578c0). You'll see the cost is a mix of Ethereum gas fee, and compute power (AWS, etc) to generate the zkSNARK proofs. 

&amp;#x200B;

\--&gt; How does this black magic zkRollup stuff work? Why is it so secure?

All Ethereum addresses that register on [Loopring.io](https://Loopring.io) are mapped to an off-chain Merkle tree, where they have a corresponding Account ID. Deposits into a smart contract also map the balances to respective ID. The state of the ""thing"" (account balances, etc) is kept in this Merkle tree under users' respective accounts. A Relayer maintains this Merkle tree. For a change to happen to the state of this structure, a user must sign a message (a request to transfer or trade) with their wallet's key. The Relayer aggregates \~1024 to \~4096 of these requests, batch processes them, updates the Merkle tree, takes the new Merkle root (which summarizes the state of the whole structure) and generates a \*validity\* proof that all updates followed protocol rules: no cheating, all signatures are there, etc. If there is any deviation to the protocol's predefined rules, the validity proof cannot be made! (this is where the alien math happens). Then, the Relayer takes the new Merkle root and the validity proof, publishes it to Ethereum (along with some \*crucial\* small extra data), so now a perfect knowledge of the off-chain ""thing"" is known to Ethereum, and known to be true. As along as Ethereum exists, a user can assert that their Ethereum address corresponds to their Account ID, and can retrieve their funds. 

I oversimplified. For a 5 minute article on it, [read this](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-3-0-overview-from-a-to-zksnarks-2c542e6c07b0); for the complete technical design doc, [read this](https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/blob/master/packages/loopring_v3/DESIGN.md); or for a 45 minute video explaining zkRollups, Loopring, and other layer 2 solutions, [watch this](https://youtu.be/edZPUeoCFCk) from our Chief Architect.

&amp;#x200B;

\--&gt; What is the worst that can happen? What are the downsides?

First of all, what CAN'T happen? Loopring (the org, the people, wtvr) cannot access your funds, ever. Loopring team can disappear, turn evil, be leaned on by superpowers, etc... your funds are always only yours, claimable back only to the Ethereum address that deposited them on the zkRollup. The whole point of a zkRollup is that its operators (the Relayer 'rolling up the txs') cannot be evil. Because all processes pass through 'circuits' to create a validity proof, with the allowable rules having been pre-specified in these ZK circuits beforehand (that's what the protocol is, just some rules in smart contracts and circuits). No validity proof = no change (new state) allowed. Relayer's hands are tied. \[Of course, smart contract risk always exists that there's a bug... but they've been [audited](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/secbit-delivers-a-security-audit-report-for-loopring-protocol-3-0-a768c2bd061a), and in the wild since Dec '19. Still, that risk exists with everything, forever\]. 

So what is the worst? In our current implementation, [Loopring.io](https://Loopring.io) is serviced by a single Relayer, which our team runs. As you see in the in first question above, this has been heavily optimized to service the Loopring protocol (so it's fast and cheap at crunching these computations... almost like a software ASIC). If we don't like 'Account ID #541' for some reason, we can exclude that account's trade/transfer request from a block. So there is a risk of censorship. Of course, there is the simple deterrent that that is bad business. If we do that, the user simply exits (and spreads the negative word!). Important point is they can always exit. The Loopring protocol actually supports the ability for multiple Relayers to take turns - so if censored by one, in one minute, the next Relayer may allow you in the next minute. [Loopring.io](https://Loopring.io) does not operate that way currently because we do not 'need' to, and we're faster/cheaper without it. But anyone is free to build an exchange or payment rail on Loopring that has this multi-operator model. A related risk is that [Loopring.io](https://Loopring.io) just shuts down (frontend + relayer) because maybe we are tired of the business, or some natural disaster hits the data centres where our servers are, wtvr. In that case, the availability of the service will be down, which may annoy some users who want to send a payment that moment. But again, they can easily and always exit (as long as Ethereum exists), and a new service built upon Loopring (relayer or frontend) can spin up in its place. Again, the multi-operator model also solves this. One relayer down, but others are there to process the blocks. As you see, [Loopring.io](https://Loopring.io), is currently laser focused on allowing the fastest, cheapest trades/payments, while maintaining 100% Ethereum self-custody guarantees. Questions as to censorship-resistance and high availability have been solved by the protocol, but are not running in our product implementation.   


I will also leave this [FAQ](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-exchange-faq-196d6c40f6cf) here which has more practical info. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you made it this far, congrats and thank you! Your a quasi-zkRollup expert now. We'd love to see you on [Loopring.io](https://Loopring.io) where you can trade/transfer fast and free, while always maintaining control of your Ethereum assets. If you do send a transfer, be sure to hit the 'tweet' button that pops up after, so you can get your 40 LRC reward :).",1591574382,ftbh9qb
All of the information Is in the medium articles posted by loopring. Its not that hard to find. ZK Snarks is well researched and tested.,1591573299,ftbfeq3
"I think the picture is pretty clear to me as it is for many others. I always look forward to adopting efficient and seamless technology.  However the future of crypto, I argue, will not be stablecoins.  I've stated this numerous times in the past.  China won't ever allow a crypto RMB. There won't be a crypto Euro either. That's why I mentioned that it's only useful for Americans and traders. On a final note, the US government will never allow a for-profit company to wield massive power and influence over its sovereign currency. USDC, TUSD and others can only grow as large as the US government and its regulators will allow them to. These are not really useful for most of the world who do not use USD in day-to-day transactions.

I absolutely understand what you mean about small fees and such. That's why I mentioned that the experience is superior to Lightning Network in all the ways that matter.  I can see it getting refined over time.  However there are many cases where minor nuances will really make a difference.  Take for example this process flow:

Me sending Nano to a friend -&gt; Friend sending Nano to an exchange -&gt; Friend exchanges Nano to fiat

With Loopring:

Me checking with friend if he has a Loopring account, then sending ETH to a friend -&gt; Friend checking if exchange has a Loopring free-to-receive address in hopes of exchanging to fiat.

Before you even reach that point, I don't know if exchanges will even bother accommodating this knowing that Loopring isn't really a permanently free protocol, aside from being a competing DEX, that they may never trust with their clients' deposits either. The entire onboarding and fiat-exchanging process will also be a technical impediment to most non-technical people.  So in the scenario above, said friend will either move to main layer to send, with fees, or he just won't use that option.

There's good value in what Loopring has done, but I just can't see it as replacing the use cases for Nano or IOTA (if it ends up working the way they intend for it to), unless it goes totally free and motivates developers to pursue the same initiatives they have on other free transaction platforms. A final developer concern would be avoiding centralization and reliance on a single second layer entity.",1591572815,ftbekle
"I don't know about their finances but I can calculate a little about their costs. Assuming they've chosen the same constants that Vitalik did in his initial writeup, it's 11 bytes of storage per transfer. One word of storage is 32 bytes and costs 20K gas, so assuming they pack storage 11 bytes is 6875 gas. Current gas price for fast execution is 18 gwei, times 6875 is 123750 gwei or 0.00012375 ETH, which at $200 ETH is about two and a half cents per transaction.

There's also some fixed cost per block, to generate the proof offline and verify it on chain, but at high volume I think it'd be a small portion of the per-transaction cost.

So that 11 bytes of storage is the main thing. Gas prices are fairly high right now, so if Loopring and similar solutions manage to reduce the load on the main chain, then maybe we can get gas prices back down to 3 gwei or so, bringing the cost per Loopring transfer under a penny.",1591571978,ftbd44f
"I think you’re missing the point of this. 

First off, yeah Loopring isn’t free but it honestly doesn’t have to be. It just has to be as cheap or cheaper than current traditional payment methods like Visa (if it’s 20 cents per transaction then I believe it’s around the same as Visa, maybe more expensive for small transactions and less for larger ones). Sure comparing it to Nano makes that extra 20 cents per transaction seem like a lot but nano has too much price fluctuation to be used how it wants to be used imo. 

Where this technology is so powerful is the fact that it allows instant transfer of stable coins for a very small fee. If you can implement this technology at every POS system you could see widespread adoption of cryptocurrency. That’s huge.",1591571033,ftbbgyf
Probably yes. If people stay for the fee less transactions they are probably likely to use the DEX from time to time which will create revenue for Loopring,1591569253,ftb8bl9
"I just tried Loopring and it's pretty awesome, but it's not quite the same as Nano.

1. Loopring isn't really feeless, they're just subsidizing the transaction fees for now: ""The Loopring protocol requires us to process every user request, including account registration, account-key-reset, deposits, and withdrawals. We charge fees to cover Zero-Knowledge proof cost and Ethereum transaction gas fee, and also to avoid Sybil attack.""
2. You're still reliant on 1st layer Ethereum fees and conf times if you want to onboard/offboard your Loopring ETH or ERC20s for storage or to use with 1st layer services that haven't implemented Loopring
3. Loopring v3 offers the same level of security as Eth IF On-Chain Data Availability (OCDA) is turned on (depends on the service's implementation of the Loopring protocol). Turning that on reduces scalability a little bit (still really high, so not a big worry), but without it you're relying on a 3rd party to keep some of the data. Meaning that in an extreme case a government could shutdown that service. So, make sure the Loopring services you're using have OCDA enabled
4. Exchanges, wallets, and DEXs have to integrate Loopring tech
5. Loopring DEXs don't automatically support all ERC20s, there's some integration work that has to be done
6. Loopring Pay transfers happen on their zkRollup, meaning the recipient must also be on it (have to register first)

That being said, this is really amazing technology, and will be great for Ethereum (and DEXs in particular). It's also really awesome for the DeFi space as a whole - traditional financial institutions beware :) I wonder if we'll finally start to see DEXs outcompete traditional CEXs...",1591567948,ftb5ycy
"I don’t think so. Nano is a protocol that will always be free. A Loopring dev stated that it's free for now, and if it’s abused with transaction spam, fees will need to be reinstated. There’s little that can done to combat spam other than to block accounts as there’s no anti-spam mechanism like dPoW. 

As for stablecoins, in reference to someone’s reply to you, I’ve stated before that they’re only really useful for Americans and traders given government oversight. The fact that the protocol isn’t free forever will be reason for developers not to go the extra mile in deploying certain solutions. To illustrate the point, you don't see other popular smart contract platforms and second layer ETH projects going to zero right now.

However Loopring is definitely more desirable than LN in my opinion. This will be a thorn to BTC maxis.",1591567636,ftb5dng

"Why will nano gain adoption when ETH has zkrollup pay now? 


https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum-770d35213408

Nano doesn’t have smart contracts, privacy, ability to use on-chain DEXes to convert to in-game tokens, support from any US exchanges or any meaningful liquidity to purchase. Now ETH just got instant free payments on a layer 1 protocol and is still upgrading to 2.0. I have never seen anyone outside of r/cc mention using nano yet everyone outside of r/cc is using or building on ETH. Fast payments aren’t the reason for crypto currency to gain adoption in the current global environment.",1591531893,ft9fknp
"Saw this at r/ethtrader. I'd certainly like to know more but the general consensus seems to be that there's nothing to stop spamming, and fees will have to be reintroduced in the future?

\------------------------------  
Hey i brought it up to a loopring dev. He is banned from this subreddit for w.e reason

This is his response in discord

""indeed, no fees is just a promotional thing right now for launch. there is an amortized gas cost we pay to Ethereum for every batch and marginal tx, but it is low enough to be negligible that we can subsidize it (for a long long time). if someone abuses it, u/mcgravier is right, and of course we will need to reinstate fees, because there's a real cost to proving these batches. let's see if that will be needed. it's not a bas experiment... and doesnt effect users, only our bottom line. as you see in other instances on Loopring.io, fees are mandated to defend against sybil attacks (such as small fee for account registration to not fill up Merkle slots). but right now we want users to get on the rollup so payments are more useful, and we think the word free may attract more folks :). of course, our ability to institute fees for the relayer to process txs has nothing to do with self-custodial security of the system. the zkRollup is 100% secure in that way.""",1591530475,ft9dypa

"Because if I want to give nano to my friend he has to download an app, if I want to do a fee-less erc20 transfer he and I need some eth to register an account and I need to pay to deposit into my loopring account and he will have to pay to withdraw from his loopring account...

"From the article:

*Because all transfers happen on the Loopring zkRollup, that means users must be on the zkRollup to send or receive these fast and free payments. So you must first register an account on* [*Loopring.io*](https://loopring.io/)*, and all you need for this is an Ethereum address. Registering an account simply means making one on-chain transaction that ties an Ethereum address to a “slot” (Account ID) in the off-chain account system (Merkle tree).*

I've tried creating an account and metamask is showing me a $2,27 fee. So there's that. I can't give you a more detailed answer since I'm not familiar with the rest if the inner workings.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong but there is also a cost to deposit/withdraw tokens from your main account to your loopring account.

So not only there are some starting fees - the user also needs to have some idea of what he's doing to complete the process. I think its a great solution but its for a different target audience than nano and it's not nano's competitor.",1591468684,ft5tx6w

It’s true that a single blockchain won’t serve the world’s computation needs, but that isn’t Ethereum’s strategy and they already have layer2s on mainnet.

"Opinions on Loopring (LRC)? Is it really a Layer-2 solution using [zkRollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/layer-2-scaling/#zk-rollups)?

All that aside, how is it in practice? Is it as promising as it seems? 

&gt; Validity proofs are intense to compute – not worth it for applications with little on-chain activity.

This seems to indicate that unless Loopring actually kicks off and gets adoption, aggregation isn't dynamic during low activity and so will be overall slower and maybe even more costly if it has some constant overhead that would normally be shadowed when aggregating hundreds of transactions, right? 

&gt; Limited to simple transfers, not compatible with the EVM.

"I'll reply to both you, and u/cometothecaml, because you both called out the same assumption I made (rightfully). First off, no Ethereum's ledger state does not grow exponentially.   


I should be working, but I'm finding this all much more interesting. I took a gander at the Loopring whitepaper and realized that I made some other assumptions that weren't true, but don't necessarily make the point I'm trying to make, a false one.

\&gt; Do you mean if the Loopring operator shut down?  

This was a hypthetical scenario. I think it's highly unlikely that any event could cause every ringNode get's taken off chain. And you're right, if that happened, other's could take up the role of validating, although I'd be stressed as heck during the downtime if I had funds in Loopring. 

\&gt; I'm not sure I understand how a ZK-rollup like Loopring would be any different if running on Cardano. 

You're totally correct. For most users and scenarios, it wouldn't. I think that's part of the proposition of Cardano right now. We're still really early in crypto adoption, but anyone switching over from Ethereum network won't want Cardano to feel like an unknown land. The proposed benefit of using UTxOs instead of accounts, is that the ""value"" is decoupled from all the history of said value.

The Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) tracks the movement of value throughout the ecosystem. It doesn't care how or why this movement happens just that it moved.  All assets are tracked on the CSL. Making the CSL multi-asset constitutes a divergence from ETH's ERC-20 standard. ERC-20 tokens (I might mess up some nuance here, but I'm learning. Correct me if I'm wrong) are essentially APIs that make a call to a smart contract in order to execute transfers of tokens. This is the reasoning behind all the Cardano people insisting that Cardano will always be cheaper than Ethereum, even at scale. With Cardano, tokens don't need to call a smart contract to transfer that value, as it can all happen on the settlement layer, which leads to the next point...

\&gt; maybe you can explain this better to me. I've looked over Hydra, and it looks like it's just state channels combined with L1 bindings to allow easer communication. 

I don't think I'm knowledgeable enough to say ""you nailed it,"" but fuck it, I think you did. With Hydra, the State Machine (SM) is the connection of each head to the on-chain ledger. This represents the initial input and final output of the head on the main chain. Frequent snapshots are taken to reflect the evolving status of the final SM output in order to minimize necessary storage for the head operator node. All that matters is the final output, so context of why the value moved is irrelevant, and there's no need to keep the history of a heads ledger, since snapshots update the SM and head consensus is reached through the same on-chain protocol. This helps slow down the growth of the overall state.

\&gt; State channels have been unsuccessful for many reasons, mainly the fixed participant set (unless you add centralized ""lighthouses"" like Lightning has), high capital requirements and exit delays. 

I won't argue with this either, and it totally remains to be seen if Cardano's implementation of the concept can succeed where others have fallen short. In this case though, I don't think we should look at it like they're doing the same thing and expecting a different result. They are designing the sharding solution so that staking pools can act as the hydra heads for the state channels. They claim in the Hydra whitepaper that incremental inputs and outputs can be executed by the SM without closing the head, though I haven't dug into the mechanics behind it yet.

The Cardano Computation Layer (CCL) is where all the other data lives. dApps, SC, Id protocols, etc. Since Hydra heads are running the same consensus protocol and tokens are native assets, any smart contracts on the main-chain CCL can be utilized by a hydra head. I don't know exactly how liquidity will work for DEXs in Hydra. I've already taken forever to respond to you guys and didn't want to stall out the conversation by deep diving. Maybe later! I'd imagine it could run into the same limitations of Loopring, with liquidity limited to participants of an individual head.

Understand that all of this is currently in testing and production, not deployed... which is frankly an advantage for Cardano shills debating its benefits over Eth. It's really easy to say, ""look, Eth is slow and expensive right now. Ada is fast and cheap right now, and lets talk about the things our respective teams are working on.""",1614203324,gomqwmq

Note that this is just how _their_ system is built, it's not representative of all rollups. I know Optimism and Arbitrum are censorship resistant because they allow any staker to produce blocks, and I believe ZKSync is similar.",1614193380,gom5sop

"&gt; Why wouldn't the whales move in periodically to sell their tokens to the peasants at a mark-up, then move back to the higher-liquidity dex to make even more money?

They will!

But this is a feature, not a bug. Arbitrageurs will keep prices on the minnow DEXs in line with prices on the whale DEXs. But their profits will be limited by the low liquidity of the DEX, meaning they won't be incentivized to pay large gas prices for arbitrage, and minnow chains will still remain ""cheap"".

&gt; the state size doesn't necessarily increase exponentially, only in a linear fashion

The Ethereum state also increases linearly, not exponentially

Linear state growth is still a challenge.

You seem to understand the protocol well, so maybe you can explain this better to me. I've looked over Hydra, and it looks like it's just state channels combined with L1 bindings to allow easer communication.

State channels have been unsuccessful for many reasons, mainly the fixed participant set (unless you add centralized ""lighthouses"" like Lightning has), high capital requirements and exit delays.

Does Hydra address any of these issues?

&gt; what would happen if Loopring just unexpectedly shut down right now?

Do you mean if the Loopring operator shut down? Well all the data is available on chain, so any user could download a Loopring client &amp; generate a ZK proof to withdraw their funds from the rollup.

I hate to feel like I'm shilling, but the eUTxO model really is better for scaling smart contract platforms. Before replying, I went back and skimmed the ""Isomorphic State Channels"" paper that IOHK put out to make sure I (somewhat) understood what I was talking about. 

Since the entire ledger is simply unspent values with all metadata nested within the values , and all tokens (on Cardano) are treated as native assets, the state size doesn't necessarily increase exponentially, only in a linear fashion, which makes growth predictable. 

The L2 solution proposed for Cardano, Hydra (it's just sharding), will work in a very similar way to Ethereum's sharding proposal, but under the UTxO model, each Hydra head (shard) operates under the exact same consensus protocol as the main protocol. So channel communication and decommitting a head becomes MUCH more simple than it is with an account based model.

Like, what would happen if Loopring just unexpectedly shut down right now? I honestly don't know, and maybe you do. But if you built Loopring on Cardano network and shut it down without warning, users would only cease to be able to use Loopring. The txs they had done on Loopring would still be valid and reflected in their balance, because all assets are native, and the consensus protocols of Hydra head are the exact same as the underlying platform. Maybe it's the same for Eth, I haven't studied it extensively, though I do hold some.",1614182031,gold8dm

"One perspective that didn't get touched on is Ethereum's L2 projects, specifically rollups.

All of the following projects are building Ethereum rollups:

* Optimism
* Arbitrum
* Loopring
* ZKSync

* Fuel
* Hermez

(btw, most of these don't have tokens yet, I think that's why you don't see much discussion of them)

Most major Ethereum projects (Uniswap, Synthetix, Aave) are aiming to move to Ethereum L2s within the year.

IMO this is an under-discussed competitor to these other L1 chains. The biggest downside of Ethereum is the fees, but rollups can significantly decrease these fees without losing Ethereum's network effects.",1614164542,gokjybw

Well written view, now I’m definitely not able to agree with some of your conclusions.

I’m actually intrigued that you find Casper to be superior.
It is such a pain in the ass.

It’s well thought out in its attempt to transition to Proof of Stake.
But the very fact the 100-120 some validators per shard, i think it was,needing to have 32 ETH to even be considered for economy a validator is just so incredibly non inclusive to everyday people, even if you had the opportunity to collect as much as possible upon reading about the steps the EF has taken to transition to PoS.

Even tho more decentralized pool options for staking are on the way it’s just so incredible how a lot of the actions taken to secure Ethereum are something only rich citizens can easily participate it.

What is it exactly you couldn’t like about delegated PoS vs pure PoS?

If you have Cosmos you and I know it’s eco system is pretty fantastic so far, but the un delegation period is itself one of my only hang ups about their approach.
Cardano’s dpos is truly fantastic if you are comparing it to many other PoS platforms. I’ve tested quite a few to see what they are like in action.

So I have a really really hard time taking any of that Casper superiority stuff.

It is so insanely easy to stake on Cardano that my mum can do it with a numbered walkthrough.

&gt;I believe the winning smart contract blockchain should have a base layer even more secure than Bitcoin.

Now that I can agree on, which is one of the reasons I really like what I’ve read about cardanos approach.

Because, as you said, there will eventually be trillions running through these value protocols and you want to have a system that cannot be exploited, hacked, cause damage enough for the chain which houses the fortunes of individuals and corporate entities alike.
ETH has had its fair share of situations due to its design.
In the attempts to address those flaws they have created a PoS that is exclusionary.

So it’s very critical that everyday people have the ability to participate in the macro economy for a more true free market and ETH being utilized as a tool to do just this is absurd.

ETH’s very actions to make it secure also make it so they cater to only the rich who can afford the infrastructure necessary to be a validator.

So again, I really cannot see the superiority after looking at the Casper FFG RPJ.

Layer 2 certainly provide clear advantages in any blockchain.
So yes.

The base layer definitely should be fast and secure enough before optimization.
Now as for a “free market” L2 approach I honestly think it’s good that there is a sharing solution even provided in the first place..
If the community wants to begin building and sharing new L2 approaches that can be voted upon then fine.

While I like the L2’s that have popped up on ETH Loopring, Matic, xDAI etc it is just strange to experience that tribalism some of us reject play out on a micro level..
It’s just incredibly frustrating to see division from people using the same ecosystem and arguing about which L2 is better.
I know bridges are being built now so that funds don’t even have to touch the base layer of ETH and some liquidity issues can be resolved.
People are scared to move bridge back to ETH so they don’t get burned by the increasing fees. Yes I know, eip1259 will address this soonish.
It’s a bit of a band aid in my opinion.

&gt; I believe in fat protocol thesis

One of the few things we may agree on.
While being one of those things that should be obvious.
I believe Cardano is one of the few protocols poised to properly funnel a large part of the market to its platform.
Even a dapp or project becoming ‘multi platform’ is a win for Cardano.

And for your viewpoint of there being distinct priorities and applications for certain protocols is absolutely correct.
We just don’t agree that Cardano will be very capable of the interoperability and being an extremely secure asset settlement layer.
Now on the part where you state you think there is no room for multiple chains I would be inclined to disagree again.

Your viewpoint of Charles is your own but to say that IOG, Emurgo and Cardano foundation have built all of this to be about Charles is where I’m just feeling like everything you said falls flat.

Charles espouses, as much as any talking head/recognizable face, crypto ideals.
I’m not one for the cult of personality thing, but I think it’s disingenuous to say you won’t invest in a project because of one human and your point of view on them, which is kind of unfair as you compare Charles to someone like say..Gavin.

Charles intentions cannot be easily skewed as being born of malice or ill intent.
So no this project isn’t about one man.
Nor has he made it about him.

That is a personal, and n my opinion,highly flawed view point. Especially when you can support CZ and his copy paste CeFi solution and when you stack people side by side you can talk I’ll of Charles and his intentions but go on to support binance smart chain..Sorry

But what the fuck.

Come on.
Vitalik is a great guy, smart.

Charles is a great guy, smart.

Both their intentions are so far from being hostile and their idealism’s not so different.
As with many things humans do, we cannot always reach 100% consensus on how to do many things.

The flack and critique Charles receives from some is a bit overplayed and pump up.
People make it sound like he is a money hungry psycho that is somehow comparable to Justin Sun. Whom it sounds like you are talking about.
If you’re second guessing his intentions and then 3 other entities I just don’t see how that is rational.

I hold Cosmos and Cardano and Ethereum and will continue to.

But my support definitely has begun leaning heavily towards Cardano.

This platform can bring hundreds of millions into participating in our growing digital economy and in turn our global economy.
Unlocking region locked wealth.
Putting power back into the hands of numerous people.

But good luck to you and the projects you may build.

"&gt;It is true. In a few short years the bitcoin blockchain will be about 900gb. A bigger blockchain reduces an individuals ability to validate coins. Today the Ethereum chain is already several terabytes, because it has much higher throughput requiring a high end machine to validate. Luckily for Ethereum, self-assaying is not a core feature!

I don't see 900 GB as a problem. Storage is getting cheaper; especially SSDs. People don't have to run a full-node, and it isn't really necessary unless you're looking to mine Bitcoins. I certainly don't use a full-node because it's not necessary, even though I have more than enough hardware to support it.

As for Ethereum being 4.5 TB, I still don't see that as a big issue, and I think you're blowing that out of proportion. You can get a 10 TB HDD that can store all that data for ~$200. This is also forgetting to mention that Ethereum has second layer scaling as well with protocols like ZkRollups, and Loopring.

&gt;You're also complaining about a full restaurant. If BCH were actually used, you'd still end up with a wait time. The demand for free transactions is unlimited, a fee market auctions off the available space. Queues will form for the tx's outbid - as can be seen with Ethereum right now. 

Sure, but if Bitcoin Cash had the same throughput usage as Bitcoin, it wouldn't be facing the same issues because of how the economics behind it work. The entire idea is to keep the network running well under capacity so Bitcoin Cash doesn't face these issues. People will eventually be free to use second layers as well for use-cases like microstransactions and transporting money to exchanges.

&gt;For crypto projects that want to be money, having a validateable blockchain is an important feature. You don't have to have this feature, but if you don't it puts it on par with gold.

You seem to be getting the wrong idea... Bitcoin Cash isn't trying to compete with gold. It is trying to compete with already existing centralized payment platforms like Visa and MasterCard, while maintaining decentralization. Either way, Bitcoin Cash is can still be validated as of right now.

&gt;BCH has 32mb blocks to Bitcoins 2mb meaning it would grow 16 times larger to about 14.4 gb in the same space of time. Nano's size is unbounded. These coins will have a few validators that validate on your behalf. Might as well use paypal.

And this isn't an issue. Bitcoin's 2 MB blocks can even be considered worse than scaling linearly because users are free to bloat witness data in a few transactions, not allowing for any additional SegWit ones. This will allow for a maximum effective blocksize of 1 MB, but end up costing the same as 2 MB+ blocks in bandwidth for nodes that are updated to accept SegWit data.

As for the coins having very few validators, that simply isn't true. No party owns close to 51% of the hashrate, and a lot of hashrate from BTC is there to protect BCH as shown in history. With PayPal, fees are more expensive, and it takes longer for transactions, so there's no reason I would want to use it over something like Bitcoin Cash. I think we can both agree that Bitcoin Cash is far more decentralized, faster, and cheaper than PayPal.",1597876657,g25igow

"[Loopring](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum-770d35213408) has some very large, immediately available scaling impact for Ethereum.

The recent news about atomic swaps for blockchain without smart contracts potentially allows the entire crypto space to integrate all blockchain features across platforms.

Eth2.0 is... progressing.  Cardano is...real.  LN is ... less horrible.

Outside of technology, I donated bitcoin through Fidelity Charitable.  I’m not sure how long that option has been available, but it was interesting to see such a service existed.",1597762158,g1zj1uu
Check out Loopring pay. Built on ETH and can handle up to 2025TPS for $0.0002 per settlement.,1597639038,g1t1vfk
"Loopring Pay = free transactions on Ethereum

Smart contract execution that interacts with 10 different contracts and exchange 8 tokens can not reasonably be considered 1 transaction",1597634265,g1sv2g1
"Just use loopring. Non custodial, no KYC. One time fee only since it's layer 2",1597633786,g1suc8r
I would agree with that statement. There are a lot of good singular products out there. Each one is slowly implementing different technologies used by other parties. Right now it seems like theyre focused on improving their dex and making a user friendly version and mobile version of loopring pay. They are estimating it will launch in September. Being able to easily pay with ERC20s and then exchange them is pretty cool. I would imagine they would eventually create automatic payment preferences where in they accept xyz erc tokens and it auto converts to n token. You could pay for anything in ETH and receive a stable token if you wanted to avoid volatility as a business.,1597492121,g1knvof
"Well loopring has other factors adding to its value. Its one of the first exchanges to natively support zk rollups. Ontop of that they're working on a wallet and payment system. So ultimately they are working towards having a dex, a wallet, and a payment system all integrated into one that uses rollups to create a super high tps, low cost, and high security system. This has the ability to take center stage in defi and allow people to seamlessly use ETH and ERC20s as viable means of payment.",1597484903,g1k5wgd
"Hopefully the exodus will be to Ethereum-based scalability solutions like zkSync, Loopring, or OMG Network.",1597476342,g1jle1q
"Loopring built a nice looking DEX but its lacking liquidity because they haven’t taylored the backend to the big AMM’s. IDEX is actually doing that right now and the new version, 2.0 is going live in the coming weeks. Although loopring is a protocol that can be implemented by assumingly anyone, the fact that its mcap is 230m with a 500k/24h volume is a bit crazy. Idex does 2m/24h volume (currently, thats is without the new rollup solution which would do roughly the same as looprings solution, namely eliminating gas fees on trades) and has a 30m mcap. 4 times the volume, 8 times less mcap, and room for improvement on volume when the rollup solution goes live. Thats a big gap between the two currently.",1597467756,g1j18b8

"* There's been no high-profile yield farming projects that are actual scams. There's risky projects, but the scammers haven't showed up just yet.
* Yield farming can provide actual value. DeFi protocols depend on liquidity, and yield farming is a great way to incentivize it. Personally, I'm hoping Loopring does a yield farming program, they've built a great DEX but it has 0 liquidity
* Assuming contracts are audited and work correctly, there's much less risk compared to things like Bitconnect. If yields drop to 0, you can remove your principal and any yields. If scamcoins drop to 0, you loose all your money.",1597445800,g1hus4r

"Copy/pasting my previous comment on this, but the tldr is that layer 2 solutions come with their own caveats that a layer 1 solution doesn't have to deal with

For example, I tried Loopring and it's pretty awesome, but it's not quite the same as Nano.

1. Loopring isn't really feeless, they're just subsidizing the transaction fees for now: ""The Loopring protocol requires us to process every user request, including account registration, account-key-reset, deposits, and withdrawals. We charge fees to cover Zero-Knowledge proof cost and Ethereum transaction gas fee, and also to avoid Sybil attack.""

2. You're still reliant on 1st layer Ethereum fees and conf times if you want to onboard/offboard your Loopring ETH or ERC20s for storage or to use with 1st layer services that haven't implemented Loopring

3. Loopring v3 offers the same level of security as Eth IF On-Chain Data Availability (OCDA) is turned on (depends on the service's implementation of the Loopring protocol). Turning that on reduces scalability a little bit (still really high, so not a big worry), but without it you're relying on a 3rd party to keep some of the data. Meaning that in an extreme case a government could shutdown that service. So, make sure the Loopring services you're using have OCDA enabled

4. Exchanges, wallets, and DEXs have to integrate Loopring tech

5. Loopring DEXs don't automatically support all ERC20s, there's some integration work that has to be done

6. Loopring Pay transfers happen on their zkRollup, meaning the recipient must also be on it (have to register first)

7. The code for layer 2 solutions like Loopring can be quite complex, and complexity can lead to security risks and other unforeseen issues

That being said, this is really amazing technology, and will be great for Ethereum (and DEXs in particular). It's also really awesome for the DeFi space as a whole - traditional financial institutions beware :) I wonder if we'll finally start to see DEXs outcompete traditional CEXs...",1597408958,g1fp9ys
"I don't see the advantage of feeless payment only tokens like nano, compared to ethereum l2 solutions like loopring wallet. With ethereum l2 there is no need for a complicated bridge between blockchain/dag, you can stay with your defi tokens etc. inside the ethereum eco system.",1597398828,g1fcsgk
"Loopring uses actual ERC20s, you can withdraw back to the main chain at any time, just like Lightning. There's no way for anyone to steal your tokens or censor your transactions.",1597357006,g1dm0it
"&gt; Lightning hasn't taken off

Define taken off.

Lightning uses actual Bitcoin. Loopring and others IOUs.",1597351245,g1d9rzt
"Because not every L2 is the same?

State channels have been a dud. Lightning hasn't taken off (Bitcoin) and Raiden hasn't taken off (Ethereum).

But there's been lots of exciting research on rollups in the past years, both ZK and optimistic. Those promise to provide high scaling without the tradeoffs of state channels. And some (loopring) are already live today!",1597350765,g1d8rbu

"I hope Ethereum L2s gain wide adoption. There are already some very promising ones, like ZK-Rollup:

https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum-770d35213408

ZK-Rollups have very nice properties:

* massive scalability of up to 3,000 transactions per second

* takes only a couple minutes to withdraw your funds from the ZK-Rollup smart contract, with the off-chain operator having no way to freeze your funds

* is completely secure - you can deposityour funds in a ZK-Rollup, turn off your computer, come back after a year, and you are guaranteed to still have access to your funds. This is unlike lightning network or plasma, which requires an always-on node that is constantly monitoring the off-chain layer to detect and react to fraud attempts by the operator.",1597328060,g1bv59r
"Layer 2 for ethereum is doing the same thing nano would do without introducing an entirely separate economic ecosystem. They're called ZK rollups. They can bring transactions off chain and make them instant and free. It is time consuming moving between layer 1 and layer 2, but I believe most ethereum products will be using ZK rollups in some form very soon. Loopring and Arbitrum are leaders in the field.",1597326542,g1bseg9

"Uniswap is a DEX that uses ETH, whenever you swap something on Uniswap it tends to go through multiple steps/swaps to get from Token A to Token B, being as it uses ETH for Gas and ETH gas fees are super high at the moment, some swaps can cost silly amounts in gas.

gas price is subject to market forces.

demand to use the network is currently high.

the exorbitant fees you see are for complex defi contracts. 

for simple transfers, fees are higher than usual, but still ok (170 gwei).

there are a number of ways in which this can be improved.

"Aren't there several Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions currently? Loopring is operational and uses layer 2 scaling. It's like a new feature comes out, but none of the devs have updated their software to include it. It just takes more time with smart contracts because it means contract migration and additional security audits. In a year, I 100% guarentee Ethereum will have many layer 2's running on ETH 1.x",1597106392,g11wtbn

"I know yes. I also know it's significantly less on layer 2. There are many of these solutions already live like Loopring, Zkstarks etc etc. The finality is still on Ethereum so it's secure but the transactions are cheap. Ofcourse the Bitcoin maxis try to hide this truth",1596982840,g0w6nhx
"&gt;However when I look at bitcoin as a currency, it just doesn’t make any sense. For example you walk into a bar for a drink. The bitcoin transaction would most likely take an hour to get through and the fees would be at a ridiculous amount. Instead of paying $10 for a drink, it will probably be $14.95.

The biggest problem that cryptocurrencies are facing is the volatility, and it can go either way. Why would you as a consumer spend cryptocurrencies when in the future your purchasing power could increase? To name the biggest example of this, 10 years ago someone purchased 2 pizzas for 10k Bitcoin, how much are 10k Bitcoin worth today (a lot).

On the flip side, why would a business accept it if it could go down in value? When it comes time for them to pay staff wages, rent, suppliers, and other business cost, the cryptocurrency they accepted a week ago may have dropped 20%. They will also need to calculate capital gains for each time they accepted and disposed of any cryptocurrencies, and set aside money to pay the tax. This last point is subject to which country the business is operating in, in mine this is the case as cryptocurrencies are viewed by the government as assets. *Any* disposal is subject to capital gains tax, even if you are gifting it to another person.

As far as lower fee alternatives go, there are projects out there such as Loopring, which can do around 2000 transactions per second with transactions costing around $0.0002. The actual protocol itself ""Loopring Pay"" is a L2 solution on the ETH blockchain, using zkRollups. They are still working on it so expect it to be better in the future. https://loopring.org/#/protocol",1596948661,g0v2z8q

Q2 (Apr-Jun) 2021

 • 16 April to 14 May - Rayonism. The Ethereum scaling hackathon @ ETHGlobal. Attempt will be be made to hack together a testnet Merge as well as data sharding. 

 • 5 May - Uniswap v3

 • Shortly thereafter (Mid-May?) - Uniswap goes live with optimistic rollups. This tweet, acknowledged by Hayden, is suggesting 12 May, but it could be as late as July to coincide with Optimism public launch.

 • May - Loopring 3.7 release, to include L2 &gt; L1 bridge (batches L1 transactions together and uses L2 to do the bulk of computation)

 • May - zkSync 2 Public testnet

 • May - zkSync 1.x NFT minting and transfers, as well as token swaps

 • Arbitrum optimistic rollups mainnet (Q2 guess by me based on their v4 release candidate announcement)

 • Optimism / DAI initial bridge. First stage towards eliminating 7 day optimistic rollups withdrawal lockup.

 • June - RocketPool live launch. Decentralised staking for all! 

 • 15 June - Go/no-go decision for Hawaii 2022

 • Synthetix v3 / L2 synth swaps - Phase 1 of the SNX / Optimism transition

 • Connext P2P Networking release

 • StarkNet Planets release. Single-App zk rollups",1619424654,gvwpg9j

"I also wanted to point out that rollups are a key breakthrough for blockchain tech in general, and not just limited to Ethereum. A lot of people get tribalistic and dismiss rollups just because it's perceived as ""only an Ethereum scaling solution"". 

You're absolutely right about rollups already being live - Loopring, DeversiFi and zkSync have been live for a year now! It's often strange to see people complaining about high gas fees when I'm literally paying zero gas to make a trade on dYdX. The sentiment will change when a major app like Uniswap V3 releases on Optimism in a few weeks, and when anyone can arbitrarily deploy their smart contracts on multiple platforms in summer.",1619327135,gvsf149

Yes but that's why I'm saying you should be using a layer 2 solution instead of transacting on the mainnet. You've been able to send transactions for free with Loopring on Ethereum for like a year.

"Last time Optimism roll up was delayed because of miscommunication. I am starting to feel skeptical of ETH; it's a risk and a bet Vitalik said, and I will treat ETH as such no matter how high their positions are. The delay of Optimism roll up for lower transaction fees may tell about something... probably something related to scalability. And with The Merge going to focused because of the miners throwing an epic tantrum, I don't think significant ETH price reduction would be in here anytime soon. It will come, the question is will it come too late? I think it is better late than never at least.

ETH has more devs and projects run on it than anyone else, true; what is also true is that there are many ETH killer promising faster and cheaper transactions.

&gt;It's been explained a million times 2.0 is on the way and will drop the fees.  We know this will be taken care of.

Tell me how long the ""roadmap"" to ETH 2.0 takes? I'm sure there has never been any hiccups related to the release date. Can you blame the users to slowly lose patience on the road to the lower gas fees on ETH 2.0? We can only hope that L2 gives enough feature to reduce the network congestion on L1, otherwise ETH would only be the second BTC, not an utility coin because the fees are too high to justify its use by non-whales.

I'm going to ask you something... does EIP-1559 going to reduce the gas fees? What does The Merge will accomplish other than moving to PoS to reduce the risk of ""miner revolt""?

That being said, while I have skepticism, I still hold a little bit of faith (because apparently everyone else does) on ETH 2.0 progression. For the time being, I think L2 solutions are available (in beta for Loopring at least) utilizing zk Rollups to transfer the Layer 1 to Layer 2 provides some sort of workaround for these gas fees issues.",1619087042,gvfg1fz

"But this isn't a good comparison to point out the weakness. Low fees on BSC are because it's centralized and **not trustless**. They could just run it as a database instead of a blockchain and there wouldn't be any fees at all. It's literally a money printing machine for Binance and their friends that nobody else can get in on. 

High fees on ETH pay for the trustlessness right now and they're being worked on. The fees are atrociously high and people know it so tons of devs are working on scaling solutions. There are many L2s you can already jump on like Loopring and Polygon where you can trade on ethereum for cheaper than BSC fees. When ETH2 and better scaling solutions like Optimism roll out the fees will be almost negligible. 

There are even rumours about gasless transactions in the works by the guys behind UniV3 and Alchemist.",1618765488,guzij5z

ETH2 is a series of upgrades, the beacon chain went live in December and you can already stake. The next part of ETH2 are rollups, some are already live like Loopring, Hermez, zksync. Over the coming months, Optimism, Arbitrum and generalizable zk rollups will launch which will finally enable dapps to easily deploy to a rollup.

Then there's the merge by the end of this year/early next year, saying goodbye to PoW. After that comes Data availability sampling which scales rollups to 100k+ transactions. Beyond that comes execution sharding.

"The issue with loop ring is a few things, mostly by design, they are working mainly on getting their entire infrastructure proper before focusing on liquidity rewards and marketing.  The low liquidity right now and lack of coins is the main factor imo.  They really didn't take advantage of being first to market with L2.  Hopefully they'll pick up stream with more marketing and better products but by that time so many competitors will have an l2 solution running.

"Yea I've used Uni, Compound, Aave, Kyber, Loopring, and Fulcrum

Nothing is risk free right. Some people trust code over humans, so they choose DeFi (smart contract exploit risk) over CeFi/CEX (counterparty risk). if you're using a trusted platform then risks are minimal (but non-zero)

If you understand and accept the risk then yea, it would be nice to optimize fees. Doesn't make sense to spend $50 on fees to swap $50 worth of tokens on Uni. Likewise if you spend $60-100 to deposit funds on Aave, you just have to do the calculus as to how long it will take for the interest earned to make up that hit

You can always initiate the transaction and MetaMask will give you the fee estimate - you can then reject the tx if it's too high for you, doesn't go through without you clicking confirm",1617664315,gtibyur

"Well even right now its cheaper to transfer from L1 to L2 on loopring and do a swap in loopring than it is to do a uniswap swap. L1 Eth to l2 is just a simple transaction so right now about $5-8 and then once you're on L2 you're basically gas free. So its still a lot cheaper than doing one swap on uniswap.

Loopring is currently working on bridges to connect L2s so you'll not have many reasons to do anything on L1 anymore.",1617638108,gtgrk8j
"Loopring is great, but suffers from the same issue all layer-2 projects are facing right now -- Ethereum is so clogged up, sending funds to layer-2 is wildly expensive. Not viable for small fish, aka the masses. Whales won't use it if there aren't any krill to feed on, so -- it sort of goes unused.

Options to make Loopring viable (or any layer-2 project for that matter):

A) Scale Ethereum, make sending to/from layer-2 less expensive

B) Entire ecosystem makes a push to move into layer-2 -- one-time, expensive fee moving funds into L2 environment. After that, everything would be cheap with near-instant transactions.

C) Fiat ramping directly into L2 environments to bypass the expensive bridge.

A is being worked on, B is not likely to happen (has potential with Uniswap moving to Optimism though), and C is underway. Several ramp companies are focusing on providing services for direct-to-layer2 ramping.",1617631742,gtge3t8
"1. Fair
2. See #3
3. Hydra is probably the area I've looked deepest into for Cardano. Yes, Hydra is much more complex than Lightning or Raiden, but at the end of the day it has the same major drawbacks as all state channel projects: capital lockup &amp; fixed participant set
4. You're right about ZK technology, but I would expect Cardano to at least be exploring it given the potential
5. The difference is that you can have a very mathematically complex transaction (such as verifying a ZK proof) that doesn't increase the state, or you can have a transaction that just stores lots of data in the state. Given that state size is the biggest constraint of blockchains, #2 should have a higher cost, but Cardano's approach seems like it would price #1 higher
6. IELE seems to be lower down the roadmap, Cardano will launch with just Plutus &amp; Marlowe
7. I agree, on chain vs off chain governance is philosophical, so no use arguing there
8. As I said, Cardano's model may work in practice, but it's definitely a weaker security guarantee. If you look at things like Visa choosing a blockchain to handle settlements, I'm sure they're going to pick the chain with the highest security guarantees
9. Re: native tokens, what are your thoughts on rollups like ZKSync or Loopring that have essencially ""native tokens""?

"Solana, Cosmos, even BSC all rose to prominence thanks to faster transaction times and lower fees than ETH.  (Arguably Cardano too.)  ETH's response has been, essentially, that several things are coming that will solve those issues for ETH (the smart contract market leader) without sacrificing decentralization.  Among those solutions are layer 2 and sidechains.  The market was impatient and put an enormous amount of money into the competing coins.  Putting sharding aside, Polygon (MATIC) represents the arrival of a meaningful sidechain.  As does Arbitrum, Loopring, Optimism and so forth (i.e., actual layer 2s).

So why did Polygon rocket up?  Because people who like and use DeFi started to use it.  All the familiar DeFi tools that existed in ETH suddenly existed in Matic, but without the transaction fees and with fast speeds.  That's a landscape shift in the crypto space.  Remember, the arrival of DeFi was the catalyst that started this bull market in 2020.  It's the killer app for institutional investors.

"They aren't even one group anyways, which is also misleading by OP.  There's multiple clients being independently developed, all of who participating in overall design of the protocol. A new one, Erigon (aka Turbo-Geth), just officially spun itself off as a separate client project.

"&gt;Literally a few thousand people are using ethereum mainnet for defi and nft purposes and you're acting like it's conquered the world with network effect, 

That's not you identifying a lie. You said ""literally everything you said there was a complete lie"", and you couldn't even point out one lie, and instead just changed the subject.

Your comment was literally 100% psychological projection.

Now moving onto your new talking point: 

It's not just a few thousand people using Ethereum mainnet. It's a few thousand people generating transactions that interact with Ethereum DeFi every day, but that's not the only way you can use Ethereum. When you read the data from the Ethereum blockchain, you are a read-only user, just as a Facebook user that just reviews their feed is still a user even if they don't post anything new.

Many more people use Ethereum as read-only users every day, in requesting data from the Ethereum blockchain to monitor their Ethereum-based assets, than as write-users.

And it's not just DeFi. There are also applications closely related to DeFi, in which there are far more users, like ERC20 tokens, which see hundreds of thousands of transactions per day on Ethereum. All this usage/adoption bolsters the utility of Ethereum-based DeFi.

And yes, this is still early, but adoption is path dependent. New projects are far more likely to use the platform that has the most users and liquidity. Even the permissioned chains being launched by exchanges, like Binance Smart Chain and Huobi Eco Chain, by Binance and Huobi respectively, are using forks of Ethereum, and have most users interacting with them using an Ethereum wallet; MetaMask. This kind of convergence around one standard is how network effects accelerate.

&gt;Do you think dapp developers are gonna be like ""no we can't can't grow our userbase now, we have to wait 2 years for ethereum to scale""?

They can use zkSync and Loopring right now, and if they want full EVM compatibility and are willing to settle for less security, Polygon's DPOS sidechain. If we look a bit into the future, there is also Arbitrum, which recently launched its beta on mainnet, and soon will open up to all users, and Arbitrum a highly secure EVM-compatible Optimistic Rollup.

So as far as scaling, Ethereum is in an extremely good position, and doesn't even need data sharding to be able to see adoption grow by several orders of magnitude.",1622607882,h0a06bg

"That's very interesting perspective. I was just reading about polkadot last night which got me thinking about all this. Do you think things like Matic, Loopring, Optimism, etc can all succeed at the same time?

I feel that BSC is only as successful as it is because of ETH's high gas fees, once they go down a bit and are more on BSC's level, I don't see why users wouldn't move to ETH or why BSC centric dapps wouldn't be ported to ETH. I'm using BSC right now just cuz ETH is too expensive but I'm eyeing July and the coming months to see what happens with ETH's gas before I make any real moves with defi.

"Pasting this here - it’s a post from last year, but still pretty relevant (I didn’t know that Arbitrum were also launching at that time):

I've seen  a little bit of this commentary recently, so i'll try to address it in a single post for clarity. Please pay it forward by educating others when you can.

Mostly it refers to the question of ""Does Ethereum launching EIP-1559/Improving their scaling/the launch of Optimism compromise the goals of Polygon?"". Mostly the question is driven by the fear of - am I in the right spot with my investment. I won't answer that question (diversify, invest in what you use, use what you invest in, sell the top!), but I will address the first with a few points:

1.	⁠⁠What is Ethereum 2.0? Despite conjecture, the Eth2 roadmap is already significantly complete. The beacon chain has been launched (http://beaconcha.in) since December. The next milestones remain to complete ""The Merge"" of both chains into a single Proof of Stake instance, and then to complete Data Sharding later. There's a lot more complex research to it, but that's the most important. These milestones improve the utillity of the base Layer (see more later), but don't increase TPS by any orders of magnitude. The complicated computational sharding that people continue to refer to as ""Ethereum 2.0"" is not happening. This is a good thing, it was always a difficult endeavour and priorities change. So how does Ethereum scale without computational sharding?

2.	⁠⁠Polygon is Ethereum 2.0 - Alongside Loopring, Optimism, ZkSnarks, ImmutableX etc, Layer 2 is the future architecture of Ethereum. You can read more here: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698 Ultimately, we are going to need all of these experiments and maybe more, and hopefully multiple technologies become viable and provide separate cost/time/security trade-offs for different dApps. For example, ImmutableX is laser focused on gaming NFTs. The only difference is that Polygon is taking a multi-technology approach, rather than a narrow single technology approach. This is ambitous, but they intend to offer all of these options under a single umbrella. As we move to an inter-chain world, this will hopefully pay off in terms of User Experience. But they will need to work closely with other teams to get this done, and that is what they're doing.

3.	⁠⁠EIP-1559 supports this vision - in this world, we need a reliable Layer 1, where roll-ups and sidechains that Polygon deploy can be consistenly and regularly checkpointed to the base chain. Gas will likely remain high on Ethereum due to roll-up demand, so EIP-1559 and Data Sharding are important projects to supercharge the base layer. While they won't give it magical scaling powers to reduce gas to zero, they will make it much more functional in a multi-roll-up world.

4.	⁠⁠Demand vs Supply - This is the classic, nobody goes there it's too crowded scenario. While it might feel like these projects are competing to provide supply, the correct way to think about it is that they are working together to ensure demand. And right now demand is far outstripping supply. While this causes the chaos of high gas, it's super healthy for the network and smart people are working very hard to build into it and overcome it. It could get messy with liquidity mining and incentive wars to bring dApps and developers into each L2 stack, but ultimately - the goal is to scale Ethereum so that people continue to want to use it - and that goal is synergistic.

5.	⁠⁠A multi-chain future - So yes, we're going to have multiple competing technologies, but we'll likely have teams working together, mergers and lots of fun to come, but the Polygon vision to combine these all under one roof makes them both a unique and an exciting prospect and an important part of the Ethereum community. Hopefully we can avoid as much bitterness and uncertainty as possible (and there will be others trying to stoke this doubt), so it's important we keep these values in mind and build towards a harmonious multi-chain future.

I hope that helps! :)",1632795375,hejp33l

"Save a click:

At the end of August, Ethereum network gas costs skyrocketed and tapped a high of $59 per transaction on September 7, according to the average transaction fee spent on that day. The median fee for an ether transaction on September 7 was around $20 per transaction. Days later, ether transaction fees have subsided to a degree as the median and average ether fees have been slashed in half since then.  
  
Ethereum Fees Subside, Transfer Costs Less Expensive  
One of the biggest complaints people have with digital currencies is how much the transaction fee can cost to send these assets. Critics don’t care for the fact that Layer 1 bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) transactions can be quite costly and unpredictable as well. The common answer for bitcoiners is the Layer 2 protocol the Lightning Network, but there are also Layer 2 schemes for ethereum (ETH) transactions.  
  
First off, a Layer 1 transaction that is settled onchain will cost an ethereum user between $3.39 to $18.74 per transaction. The $3.39 quote is for a very low priority transaction according to Etherscan gas tracker statistics and the $18.74 stems from the metrics recorded for an average ethereum transaction, according to bitinfocharts.com. The same website also tracks the median-sized ether fee which is $9.29 at the time of writing. Data from the website l2fees.info indicates that a Layer 2 ethereum fee is currently $4.46 per transaction.  
  
These fees don’t account for smart contract interactions which can be more costly. For instance, Etherscan gas tracker stats show a common ERC20 transfer is $10.48 and using Uniswap can cost a person $32.25 at the time of writing. This means moving a token balance, interacting with a decentralized exchange (dex), or using an NFT marketplace can be more costly than simply moving ethereum from A to B. For this reason, Ethereum network competitors are nipping at the project’s heels.  
  
Ethereum proponents have a few defenses when it comes to the subject of high fees, and a large majority of ETH supporters believe the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade will settle the matter. Additionally, there are Layer 2 projects and concepts like “optimistic rollups” and two specific projects Optimism and Arbitrum are leveraging this technology. Moreover, ether gas killers like hermez.io, aztec.network, starkware.co, loopring.org, zksync.io, and fuel.sh also aim to solve the transaction bottleneck and high fees.  
  
Some of these projects are being used today, as Bitcoin.com News reported on Arbitrum’s recent $1.5 billion total-value locked (TVL). The website l2fees.info shows the costs associated with these ether gas killers and while they are lower, some are still much higher than Ethereum network competitors. At the time of writing, a Loopring-based transaction will be around $0.11 according to l2fees.info stats on September 12. Zksync is $0.18 to send a transaction and Polygon Hermez is $0.40 per transaction.  
  
An Arbitrum One send at the time of writing is $1.61 and an Optimism transaction is $2.38. Fees for Ethereum network competitor blockchains are lower than sending a common ether transaction. Stats from Messari.io note that the average transaction fee on September 6 for the crypto asset cardano (ADA) was $0.59 per transaction.  
  
The blockchain Solana (SOL) indicates on the project’s website that the average SOL send is $0.00025 per transaction. Meanwhile, the sister page of l2fees.info, cryptofees.info, shows that $22 million in ether fees were raked in on September 12. On the same day, the dex Uniswap saw $3.3 million in fees and $4.9 million in fees during the last seven days.  
  
Bitcoin (BTC) saw $448K worth of fees and BTC miners gathered $680K in fees over the last week. While Optimism saw $285K during the last day, Avalanche (AVAX) saw around $216,607 in 24-hour average fees. Arbitrum One fees during the last 24 hours were around $90K.",1631561869,hcq99ot

Algo is Eth for poor people. It's fun as hell. I love it.

"[Here is a great link explaining the difference between zero knowledge rollups and optimistic roll ups. ](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/)

TLDR: Loopring is a zero knowledge roll up that inherits the security of Ethereum and validates transactions off chain on Layer two in bundles reducing gas fees to pennies the dollar. 

Loopring also has a superior order matching protocol in their [patent](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=2&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=Loopring&amp;OS=Loopring&amp;RS=Loopring)

Here is their [whitepaper](https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf)

“ Loopring is an open protocol for building decentralized exchanges. Loopring operates as a public set of smart contracts responsible for trade and settlement, with an off-chain group of actors aggregating and communicating orders. The protocol is free, extensible, and serves as a standardized building block for decentralized applications (dApps) that incorporate exchange functionality. Its interoperable standards facilitate trustless, anonymous trading. An important improvement over current decentralized exchange protocols is the ability for orders to be mix-and-matched with other, dissimilar orders, obviating the constraints of two-token trading pairs and drastically improving liquidity. Loopring also employs a unique and robust solution to prevent front-running: the unfair attempt to submit transactions into a block quicker than the original solution provider. Loopring is blockchain agnostic, and deployable on any blockchain with smart contract functionality. At the time of writing, it’s operable on Ethereum [1] [2] and Qtum [3] with NEO [4] under construction.”",1640929764,hqnegbb

"LRC provides solution for cheaper gas

* Loopring uses an automated market maker (AMM) to set the exchange rate between tokens. Although the platform's fees are not zero, they are very close. 

* Compared to Ethereum's 16%, the current swap fee on Loopring is 0.3%. As you would expect, the fee funds the protocol: 0.2% goes to liquidity providers (LPs), and 0.1% goes to the Loopring developers.

As per the article.",1640918638,hqmsevm

"Several Layer 2 rollups have been released, however it will take a while for users to migrate over - check out Arbitrum.

The current NFT craze means people are willing to spend a lot on gas fees minting if they think they can recover them and make a good profit on the sale. Hopefully OpenSea will migrate to Immutable X soon. You can also now mint NFT’s on Loopring.",1630645807,hbetma1
The rumor is they've partnered with loopring.,1630590585,hbbdk8o

"You already can with things like Loopring, and Arbitrum went live today.",1630510597,hb75wai
"I haven’t done any research in to the tokenomics, but they were obviously ready quite early on but never got any real traction. As an exchange I think it’s a very crowded marketplace but I saw the other day that they now support NFT’s and that could be a very good pivot for them. They’ll face stiff competition from Immutable X, but again seem to be the first one to get a product to market. Maybe they just need better marketing or incentives?

zkRollups are preferred long term over optimistic rollups and so I’m bullish on StarkWare, but who knows what that means for Loopring. I think there will be a lot of competition initially, but then each rollup will carve out a niche. Once you can seamlessly transfer between rollups then I think it’s less of a concern.",1630509866,hb7448x
"You seem to be knowledgeable on Rollups and familiar with Loopring so I'm curious as to what you think of it? 

I'm biased because I am invested somewhat heavily. It is a bit of a hunch. Wondering if you think it can get more app development and adoption? Or is it destined to fall behind Arbitrum and the others?",1630509370,hb72wlw
"Loopring is an application specific rollup that only supports a single decentralized Uniswap-like exchange. It obviously didn't see huge adoption because it can't support general purpose smart contracts which are necessary for all sorts of dapps to deploy there.

Arbitrum is fundamentally different in that it already has 400+ dapps in the works to migrate there, which means it will see a lot more demand as it has so many more uses.",1630497898,hb6e84i
And Loopring with LRC,1630493985,hb68604
"Sure, but it's more than just because it has low liquidity, its because Loopring's zkRollup ONLY works for Loopring, that is the problem, whenever a new L2 / side chain solution is announced, the hype dies quickly when it release, why? Because functionality is severely limited to one or 2 applications, then people kinda gave up and forget about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also since Arbitrum is live now, how much it cost to transact simple Eth transfer or Uniswap swap contract? 5 cents? If not, when will it be 5 cents or 20 or 50? Which dapps is going to implement Arbitrum? Uniwap? Guess not, they are still working on Optimism, and it cost a hell lot to move Eth into that, and you'll need to wait at least 1 week to move back from Optimism chain to Eth, which is hilarious that it's even an option at this point, who would wait 1 week to get back their Eth? 

&amp;#x200B;

You guys don't get it do now? There is no amount of L2 or side chains that can solve gas fee or TPS issue because they need to compete with each other, and they are not interoperable with one another. Also the developers would not commit to any L2/side chain without the confidence that people would use it, or really even without any incentives to do it. The only way to solve this is Eth 2.0 itself, moving to Proof of Stake, the core, the engine itself need to be upgraded so that all dapps instantly benefit from the high TPS throughput. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I have even no idea why they are delaying Eth2.0 but this much.",1630475049,hb5l6i4
"There’s quite a big difference - Loopring is one exchange with low liquidity, whereas Arbitrum has the whole ETH ecosystem onboarded",1630471075,hb5f41q
"just like the zkRollups on Loopring, people will soon forget about this.",1630468247,hb5a82n
"I’m aware of the improvements sharding will bring. Yet I remember the sheer cost of moving funds to loopring (note: I’m “poor”) and how many months i had to wait before I could release a few scattered hundreds of dollars in the Eth ecosystem. 

My concern is not with L2 solutions: it is about small fund holders trapped in L1. EIP-1559 stabilized fees at a higher baseline than when I started playing with the network. This is untenable for small account holders.",1630467228,hb58bx7

"##5 years ago -  

- Ethereum was very new and it was obviously ground breaking smart contracts tech.

- ZCash was the first real use of Zero Knowledge proofs which is very new cryptography 

- Decred was the first to pioneer blockchain voting and automatic upgrades, a feature that’s been copied by many projects since, like Cardano and Tezos

- Dash was the first project to have a portion of the inflation go into a treasury account that can be used to fund development and marketing. This has been copied by Cardano and others 

##Today - 

- Arbitrum is supposed to launch the first open EVM compatible Rollup, that’s pretty ground breaking for off-chain scaling. 

- ZkSync, Loopring, Aztec, et. al. Have launched the first zkRollups which is amazing tech. zkRollups are obviously the future but these early versions are not yet EVM compatible. 

- Solana’s Proof of History seems interesting and promising for L1 scalability

- Avalanche consensus model seems very promising but I don’t know enough about it to form a strong opinion yet. 

- Dfinity’s Internet computer, this one is very hated but it’s tech is so much different than everything else in the blockchain space right now that it’s worth paying attention too. Again, it remains to be seen if this is groundbreaking or just a huge flop but it has some potential I’d say. 

##In 5 years - 

Impossible to know which new innovation will come but I’d be willing to be that Ethereum is still absorbing use cases and innovation like it is today.",1630009172,hagvyiz

It will never gain adoption as a currency. People don’t care. Countries that actually need a currency like Nano usually don’t have widely available internet access anyways. And by the time they do, the Ethereum ecosystem will have grown even larger to the point of swallowing both the privacy coin use case and the fast, low fee currency use cases thanks to ZK Rollups. 

If all the critical financial infrastructure is on Ethereum, why use Monero when you can use a zkRollup like AZTEC to use privacy coins and stay within the ecosystem? Why use Nano when you can use a Rollup like zkSync or Loopring to do instant feeless transfers while staying in the Ethereum ecosystem? 

Much easier to use a dex or Rollup on Ethereum than it is to use a centralized exchange to convert to Monero and then back into ETH when you want to interact with defi or other dapps. Much easier to never leave the ETH ecosystem in the first place.",1629903419,haasl54

Next to that loopring again on the lil dip from when eth came down from 4K. I think L2 will be the future of eth namely ZK roll ups as they’re the only real secure solution so far.,1629637551,h9wle87
"Counterpoints:

1. ETH's problem with scaling are inevitable since you can't have decentralization while having scalability. For example, most people won't just go out and buy a 4TB SSD just so they can run a node, so if you make your blockchain size that big, people won't sync nodes since they don't want to have to run a separate machine just to run a node.  
Basically any high TPS chain is or will be centralized since once the chain reaches 10TB in size, good luck trying to sync a node on your gaming PC.
2. Despite everything you mention, ETH still makes up the majority of TVL (just go to DeFi Llama). Also, BSC and Matic are actually clones of ETH, meaning people can just copy code. The same can't be said for ADA, which requires devs to learn a completely separate programing language to use AND which uses a completely different style (UTXOs vs account based). On top of this, Cardano DEXes require a centralized backend server to actually work because of limitations with the UTXO model, which is a far cry from how DEXes like Uniswap work.  
Also low fee trading already exists on ETH (see Loopring and Uniswap on Optimism) and Arbitrum is launching by the end of the month.
3. ADA is way overvalued since chains like BSC, MATIC, SOL, AVAX, etc. actually work right now and have smart contracts, yet they have a smaller market cap. If smart contracts were all that mattered then these chains should have a higher market cap, right?
4. Simply not true. Let's look at the SundaeSwap whitepaper: https://www.sundaeswap.finance/papers/SundaeSwap-2021-06-01-Fundamentals.pdf  
""This model, however, has a fatal flaw. Because any given eUTXO can only  
be spent once, as part of one transaction, it appears as if only one swap can  
happen per block. On the Cardano blockchain, there is roughly one block  
every 20 seconds. This would be abysmal throughput for a decentralized  
exchange.""  
This is why Cardano DEXes require a centralized backend server to aggregate everyone's trades into one. This makes the MEV problem worse, and also makes it impossible for smart contracts to use a DEX. In short, UTXOs completely break composability since there is no such thing as a global state. Also Vitalik is not stupid and if Cardano was really doing something good, he would be trying to copy it. The fact that everyone in ETH is focusing on rollups as opposed to state channels should tell you everything about scaling.
5. I'll admit Cardano has a giant community, but I simply think their technology isn't great so I'm not investing.",1629581977,h9u3n1a

"The difference is that ETH as a platform is capable of general purpose computation. It can *actually* scale, right now. ZK-snark based platforms like loopring exist right *now* that do order of magnitude scaling.

"Did you even read my post? You clearly didn't. And I bet you just copied and pasted these arguments straight from your echo chamber without doing any critical thinking. I can easily prove all of your points wrong.

Is this a joke? Rollups are live on the mainnet (Synthetix are using them for claiming staking rewards), DEXes like Loopring and Deversifi are also live running on L2, Tether has moved some of their USDT over to OMG Network's L2 and sister chains like xDai are seeing as many as 80K tx/day.

&gt;Ethereum 1.0 is being scrapped in favour for a new coin, eth2.0

Again, not true. As I outlined in my post, ETH 1 gets folded into its own ETH 2.0 shard. This means that it is the same network all along, we're basically just adding 63 other chains in parallel and then moving the ETH 1 shard from proof of work to a proof of stake consensus algorithm. ETH the asset will remain the same the whole time.

&gt;Eth2.0 will be proof-of-stake, that means all the value that was derived from mining will no longer exist. Honestly, sell your ETH now for maximum profit.

There is no evidence to suggest that proof of work is necessary for a token to have value. Just look at one of the dozens of PoS chains with valued tokens.

&gt;These are exchanges, retarded comparrisson proves nothing cherry picking dumb logic.

And Bitcoin isn't stored on exchanges? The presence of exchanges should have no significant effect on the relevance of this data. Besides, Bitcoiners like to say not your keys, not your Bitcoin, so it shouldn't matter who owns the wallet, right?",1603798507,ga9gxdx

"Good stuff here: 

[Aztec launches private smart contracts as Ethereum rollup](https://cointelegraph.com/news/aztec-launches-private-smart-contracts-as-ethereum-rollup)

&gt;Aztec, a privacy protocol developing on Ethereum, announced on Monday the launch of its second iteration, promising private transactions and smart contracts while being cheaper than standard transfers.

&gt;The layer two solution adopted by Aztec relies on zkRollups, similar to Loopring or ZkSync. All these protocols rely on zero knowledge proofs to help Ethereum scale, but come with different benefits and focused use cases.

&gt;Loopring focuses on the decentralized exchange experience, while ZkSync aims to be a generalized layer two protocol that could boost Ethereum’s transaction throughput.

&gt;Aztec, in comparison, makes a heavy focus on privacy while still allowing a certain degree of scalability. The team says that the rollup can reach 300 transactions per second while allowing shielded ERC-20 token transactions and private interactions with decentralized finance protocols. Users would be able to trade on Uniswap and other exchanges as part of a pooled contract, similar to how it works in Incognito, a cross-chain privacy protocol.

&gt;The stated throughput is a far cry from potential figures on other zkRollup solutions, but it is still well above Ethereum’s maximum theoretical throughput of 40 transactions per second. As Cointelegraph highlighted earlier, privacy always carries a performance cost. Tom Walton-Pocock, the CEO of Aztec, told Cointelegraph that its limit primarily has to do with potential mass exits: ""In order to guarantee that users can withdraw from our rollup, all of the encrypted data generated by a transaction must be posted on chain as call data.""

&gt;One of the innovations introduced by Aztec is Noir, a private smart contract language. This could let developers send private transactions and use on-chain cryptographic routines while benefiting from privacy. ""The main purpose of Noir is to incorporate data privacy,"" Walton-Pocock said. The rollup also features social recovery by default, and has several usability benefits like human-readable accounts.

&gt;The network is currently live on the Ropsten testnet with no specific indications as to its mainnet release, though Walton-Pocock alluded to a launch before the end of the year.

&gt;Layer two technologies are often seen as the next step in Ethereum evolution, allowing to carry some of the burden off the main network while sharding is still being developed.

&gt;Competition is fierce in this segment, with the first solutions like OMG Network’s Plasma having reached production. Smart contracts on layer two, which could help DeFi scale, have still largely eluded developers. Solutions like Optimistic Rollups and some types of zkRollups are poised to solve that problem, but are still relatively far off from a full launch.",1603400825,g9ov0uw
"Any new chain will have a very difficult time beating out Ethereum's network effects.

Thats why I think Ethereum L2s are the most promising ""Ethereum Killers""

There's many companies building scaling solutions using Optimistic Rollups (Optimism, Abitrum), ZK rollups (Starkware, Matter Labs, Loopring) and sidechains (xDai).

We're also starting to see major projects like Synthetix and Gitcoin supporting these L2s. I think the next few months will have a lot of big developments around this scaling tech.",1603318997,g9l7zx9
"PayPal, Coinbase and BitPay need to team up with one of the Ethereum-based ZK-Rollup projects, whether it's Loopring, ZKSync, Starkware, AZTEC Network or Hermez, and integrate their payments into their merchant portals, so that crypto payments at scale can actually happen.

ZK-Rollups allow Ethereum to process 3,000 transactions per second, on chain. With privacy, which may be required for these companies, especially to comply with regulations like GDPR, that goes down to 500 transactions per second, because private transactions require more data, but PayPal process that many transactions per second, so it would be sufficient for its needs.",1603289117,g9ji7p8

Stop trying to make sense out of a failed copy-paste project on a shitty chain that no one uses.

While I still disagree that it's the solution for fast and virtually free transactions, I can see why this is valuable for eth itself. 

 I just don't consider side chains the answer to scale. This has risks and is not as secure as main chain transactions and while complexity isn't bad (as you said, all could be in the background), point-of-faliures have been added in both transactions and funds on the side-chain. 

Plus the use of another token is a turn-off. If the tokens where created by wrapping Eth, that's something I'll consider since no supply is created.

The bad: Very low liquidity on certain tokens and very limited orderbook pairs.  Hopefully this will improve as it gains more popularity.

The good: I've made a few swaps and an orderbook trade; basically instant and fees are miniscule.

Thoughts on Loopring?,1610424240,giyroc7
"Sure. TL;DR: A lot of scaling options coming to ethereum very soon.

The two main layer-2 solutions for scaling are Zk-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups. These are basically doing all the computations offchain and posting proofs onchain. Many ethereum dapps plan to use rollups, including Loopring, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Synthetix, and most of DeFi at this point. With rollups and eth 2.0, Ethereum will be capable of scaling up to 10-100k TPS.

There are a few other potential layer 2 solutions as well:

Plasma (state channels, like in the Bitcoin lightning network) which is being employed in Matic and OMG.

Sidechains that run completely independent of Ethereum but are set up to bridge onto ethereum (usually using rollups). The main sidechain being developed currently is Skale. Most of the Ethereum competitors that have any chance of existing long-term are also figuring out some sort of bridge. This technically isn't layer 2, because the security isn't anchored to layer 1 in any way, but these solutions are often scalable even more on their own.",1610423754,giyqrsy

"You can just let the transactions stay in the pool and eventually replace them when you need to make a transaction. They may eventually go through and fail though. 

Ethereum’s fees are a result of high usage while maintaining decentralization. The right move is for xDai and Dai to move to layer2 solutions so you don’t need to worry about base network congestion.

My take away from my time being invested is that Loopring has a dedicated team, a working product, and a bright future, but it has the same problem a lot of cryptos have which is adoption. I feel like the tokenomics are currently not that good, honestly, that's an understatement, the tokenomics are actually quite bad which is why the price action is stagnating. There's no incentive to use LRC on the wallet besides the fact you can pay transaction fees in LRC but it's the equivalent of paying your fees in ETH or stablecoins, there's no discount. The only real value LRC has right now is that it's giving as a reward during Looprings mining and trading contests. That's pretty much it, to put it into perspective, there are only 4 trading pairs for LRC and 3 active pools on the LRC exchange.",1615875565,gr3i0fb

1. Gas fees are high because usage is high.
2. This is not easily solvable by other blockchains, due to the [blockchain trilemma](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html).
3. This is not solved by EIP-1559. EIP-1559 solves [other problems](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559#motivation)
4. This will not be solved by ''ETH 2.0"", ETH2 is [the change from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake](https://ethmerge.com/).
5. This **will* be solved by Layer 2. Lots of people are working on solutions. (See below)
6. In the future, [data shards](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/) will significantly decrease fees on these solutions, but not on L1.
7. Gas fees are not at 1000 gwei all the time, as some screenshots might suggest. You can see the historic average gas price on [gasnow.org](https://www.gasnow.org/)

The end goal of Ethereum is for users to do almost all their transactions on Layer 2 solutions. You''ll be able to buy some ETH on [Coinbase](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-protocol-team-advances-crypto-community-aa9b3748bac5), send it through Optimism or Arbitrum to something like [Hop](https://hop.exchange/) where you'll be able to hop on to immutable to buy an NFT, which you'll be able to move to another L2 where you can use it as collateral for a loan.

Examples of Layer 2 solutions are:

- [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) - Already usable in alpha phase
- [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.one) - Coming within the next few days
- [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/), Using [Starkware](https://starkware.co/) - One of the first, already usable perpetual trading platform.
- [Immutable X](https://www.immutable.com/) - Already usable, NFT market (focus on games)
- [Hermez](https://hermez.io/)
- [Aztec](https://aztec.network/)
- [ZKSync](https://zksync.io/)
- [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/)

"No, it isn't.

'Eth 2.0' is the switch from pow to pos.
There will be no material effect on gas fees or traffic.

Sharding can only be introduced after the switch to pos. This may very slightly alleviate high gas costs, but in reality that's only because it will allow rollups/L2 solutions e.g. loopring, polygon to have even higher transaction throughput at lower cost.

The eth devs including VB have confirmed this over and over and have repeatedly advised people to use L2 solutions, and people seem to just want to ignore this and live in denial thinking the merge is going to solve everything.

There will aways be great projects without followers who never got the funds and communities they needed, especially with crypto being early global adoption phase.

"FROM COIN BUREAU RE MATIC:

Hey Guys,

As mentioned in my video on top picks above, I decided to add MATIC to my portfolio.

This was based mainly on the fact that it has become the predominant Layer 2 solution for Ethereum scaling. TVL in the Polygon network has just broken through $10 billion again and keeps on growing.  

Many of the most popular Ethereum dApps have now been deployed on the Polygon network as well. 

So, after having added MATIC to my portfolio, I was quite surprised to see this news about a merger with the Hermez Network:

https://www.coindesk.com/polygon-merges-with-hermez-network-in-250m-deal

The reason that this caught my eye was because Hermez is a Rollup platform that uses Zero Knowledge cryptography to help scale Ethereum. 

As you may or may not know, Polygon uses Plasma which is a child-chain root-chain architecture.

So, the fact that Polygon has decided to merge with Hermez means that ZK technology will now become part of the Polygon network. It will utilise the tech in order to further scale the network and increase its usability. 

It's also a major shot across the bow of some of the other Ethereum scaling solutions. Other projects that use ZK rollups (Loopring for example) could find it pretty difficult to compete against the combined and more powerful force that is Polygon Hermez. 

Even projects like Optimism that use Optimistic rollups could find it a struggle. Their main USP over Polygon has been diminished because of this merger. Moreover, they have been quite slow out of the gates and this delay has meant that most of the adoption has taken place on Polygon.",1628965484,h8xt599

"So at this point I kinda don't have anything more to say in general, it really depends on the specific things we are talking about. For example, on optimistic rollups (eg Arbitrum and Optimism) the ""syncs to L1"" are not instantaneous. But this is not the case on zero knowledge rollups (eg Loopring and Starknet). 

In terms of cross chain syncing, that will be up to each individual chain who they want to link with and how they are going to implement the link. 

But all of this will be completely abstracted away from the user. The whole vision of the network is that consumers never actually think about any of this, in the same way that you and I never think of TCP/UDP or HTTP/SSL. The idea is that developers will deploy applications where it makes sense to have them; sometimes that will be a single L2, sometimes multiple, sometimes L2s and sidechains, etc. 

Regarding security, the risks you're describing will definitely exist at the application layer (including those applications that move assets between L2s). But that is not really the concern of Ethereum. Ethereum will ""manage its relationship"" with each L2 individually, it doesn't really care what the L2s do with each other. 

The analogy would be that the Federal Reserve just keeps accounts with the big banks on an individual basis. Even though the banks trade with each other (and consumers trade with the bank, and with each other), the Federal Reserve just manages the 1-1 relationship of bank-fed.

How do you convert your exiting eth to cheaper solution? Don’t feel like converting to sol bcuz of attacks. Sol too much centralized. How does someone use loopring or polygon to create transaction using existing eth? Like from ledger wallet,1639327250,ho9iczu
"That sub is a fucking mess ahaha. I never joined the Shiba or doge subs cause I wasn't invested, but I can imagine they look a similar way. I actually feel anxious for the apes in that sub posting how they've wacked thousands into loopring. Have they not considered the hype might die and the price goes down or are they just choosing to ignore it and hope for Riches? It's amusing to say the least.",1639327213,ho9i9ou

Loopring is cool, but it also went from $0.40 to nearly $4 in no time. The pump brought out so many people saying another 10x was guaranteed in a few days time.",1639315436,ho8rsbs

"I'd suggest Polygon. They may just hit it out of the park with Mir, a general-purpose ZK solution. Polygon is already the leading scaling solution.

Another might be StarkWare, whenever they're done with their general-purpose ZK scaling solution, but they already have application-specific solutions running on their protocol.

Horizen it seems has a general-purpose ZK crosschain, but not sure if it's EVM compatible.

I'm curious to see what LoopRing does, but they seem limited compared to what's coming soon.",1639310389,ho8kc7f

"Ethereum was the first big cryptocurrency to utilize blockchain technology to use smart contracts. So while mining Ethereum and logging its transactions miners are also running a virtual machine to process smart contracts and by extension dApps and DeFi. As more people have hopped on Ethereum and its price has gone up it has become increasingly expensive to use as complicated transactions use more space and you need to pay a ton in gas. It's to the point where the average Joe can't afford to do anything but buy and sell.

So they wanna improve Ethereum with Ethereum 2.0. This was a big list of changes and improvements that people wanted to make but have proved increasingly complicated so they've been spaced out more and more. Two big changes are Proof of Stake and sharding. Sharding will make it way more efficient so transaction fees will go down and Proof of Stake will make it not need to be mined in huge pools.

How do you bandaid fix/patch it in the meantime? What if we hooked up other chains to Ethereum to process a bunch of small transactions into one big one that could be submitted to Ethereum to save space and computation power? This way its got Ethereum's security, just way better organized. These are layer 2s and sidechains of which there's around 20. Polygon, Immutable, Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, zkSync, Starkware etc... These use their own wallets (almost all are Metamask compatible) and their own tokens/coins that usually translate 1-1 with Ethereum. Dapps just need to be rewritten to be compatible with these extra chains. 

So OpenSea works on Ethereum and Polygon and NFTs can be transferred across, so to save on gas you'd wanna mint/buy/trade on Polygon and if necessary bridge them across as little as possible.

As for what to invest in? Try shit out, see what sucks and what doesn't. And then invest in what doesn't suck.",1639286743,ho7pnhy
"Gotcha. I haven't been around long enough to have a clue how low it could go. I'm still way up but it's because I swing trade so I wasn't really in. My only hold is Loopring, and I bought it under a dollar so I'm up there too. But I do not want to have to hold a bag in the red for years. My plan when I started (6 months ago lol) was to build enough to move into top 10 coins by Spring.  wasn't expecting a huge slow down this soon. I was hoping to finish the year strong. I thought about moving everything to stable coins, but I thought about it too long and missed it. I'm learning to trust my instincts way more. Faster decisions would change my life.",1639282482,ho7hrtc
Loopring layer 2 skin roll ups. Once you pay the gas fees to get on later to you can trade erc 20 tokens for one percent of the transaction or less,1639280445,ho7drni

Because of the stability of Eth I think Loopring and Matic will do fine. COSMOS should also survive and do well but that one I'm least sure of. Polkadot/Kusama together will be fine as well. MANA/BAT will do fine as well.

"Lol exactly what i was going to say.
Also, what's with all this loopring shilling? Oh and this crappy Sol coin that is definitely never hoing to moon.... Ada... Did i mention we ahould never buy btc or eth because too many people talk about it? DEFinitely don't buy algo and actually try using it because, and this part is actually serious, you probably won't want to buy any of those other L1s anymore. 

In all seriousness, I used ETH's defi ecosystem like crazy when it first popped up and it was obvious it was going to explode and then become unusable one day. Been using Algorand's ecosystem since day 1 (first apps this summer) and, once again it is obvious this is going to explode but I don't see this becoming unusable one day. I truly think it is the actual future L1 that we'll all be using 2022+. If you're not accumulating ASA alt coins then you're prepare to relive the fomo of seeing ETH's defi ecosystem take off without you once again. I'd recommend YLDY, OPUL, SMILE, and soon AlgoFi, ZONE, FolksFinance, XGLI and lots more down the road lol. Just got a bridge for BTC and ETH (AlgoMint GoBTC and GoETH). Liquidity staking coming. GlitterFinance bridging from SOL, DOT, etc to bring more value over as well... This is on the very cusp.",1639266938,ho6m3xu

Look into Loopring(LRC). People that are telling you to buy Mana and shit just got into crypto. I’ve been in the game since 2013. Mana is a dead project. No more development will be done to it nor ever will be. The owners sold out back in the day. It’s an abandoned project. Why buy something that has no growth? The next biggest meta coin imo though is Enji coin and Loopring. loopring is going to be huge though. Highest TPS rates. Best security out there. And no fees when you use it.,1639263034,ho6dgso
It will stay up because it isn’t about loopring,1639261941,ho6azus
"I bought quite a bit of Axie Infinity, Solana and Avalanche when they were all still a couple of dollars each.

Also holding many others such as Algorand, XRP, ADA, Loopring, CRO, VeChain,  Mana, Sandbox and others.",1639260335,ho67ggu
"This is also a huge problem with Coinbase, even on Coinbase Pro.

Like Binance, my Default Portfolio is always floating around $2, but the available balance to withdraw or trade is 0 across the board. Additionally, all of the Coinbase Earn programs have left me with \~$15 on my account in dust that I can't interact with in any way.

CEXs like Coinbase generally claim to have 2% of tokens held in hot funds. I wouldn't be surprised if this inaccessible dust is part of it.

Gemini does the same thing. If you select ""100%"" to sell, it will actually select 99% (which Binance also does) and leave you with dust on both ends of the trade (fiat / crypto). I have to manually enter in 100% which isn't always possible since the amount of tokens being traded is changing - consider when Algorand used to be able to trade in fractionals, but now they only allow whole-number trades.

Lastly, something I've found while trading Loopring (LRC) on Coinbase Pro is that I'll put in an order for a certain amount of fiat (say, $25) and it *will leave me with LRC dust*. That is, they'll sell me 8 LRC tokens, but the amount of dust I have in my wallet is equivalent to, say, $1.25 in LRC, but they do not show it visibly.

Frankly, I'm not sure why this isn't discussed more.",1639259211,ho64zjk

"I can only speak for myself, and I will definitely be keeping my LRC if no announcement is made this quarter. I am not someone who is investing in Crypto solely for a quick buck (although im all for it lol) but rather putting at least some of my money in technology that I believe in. Loopring protocol is capable of 4,000 transactions per second, and that will scale 100x to 1000x further when Eth 2.0 merge happens, according to Loopring. The fact it can handle such speed and do so virtually for free, is really amazing to me and i see it having value for many organisations looking to transition to Blockchain. Further, unlike competitors like Polygon, it actually has the same security as Ethereum, which i value as a user. Their counterfactual wallet also allows for social recovery option which provides peace of mind for me as well, i value that they valued security enough to include this. So to me, there is just a lot of good tech behind it, and i think its just a matter of time until its value begins to be realised and utilised on large scale, if not via the partnership with Gamestop.",1640858700,hqj3eo8

Gen 2 crypto was ETH the first smart contract blockchain. What followed were/was a million new smart contract blockchain clones and “eth killers”. We’re currently at the tail of this gen and ethereum clones will stop appearing.

"I do mean that, yeah. I agree that in their current stage, losing your recovery key and losing your house as a result would be a horrible experience, and it would never take off if that were the case. It does seem like some people are already working to solve that problem though. I’m not too sure of how the tech works behind it, but my understanding is that Loopring is making it possible to recover wallets in various ways, including having multiple trusted people be able to recover it somehow. I’m not sure if there’s other projects trying to solve that as well, but it’d be a huge game changer in the long run. We definitely gotta solve NFTs for smaller things like tickets for events first, and work on the bigger things later",1640821931,hqh7vgz
"Again tho, taking profits is safer, especially when coins are mainstream and trending, but you never really know when the market decided to pull back. Here's an example. I bought loopring at 20 cents in like March 2020. I sold it at like 40 cents months later, but bought back at 30cents bc of a gut feeling. Now for months loopring was sitting around doing jacksquat. But suddenly it's increases to like 80 cents. I thought of taking profits because it felt like it was overvalued and a correction was imminent. I decide to hold, a few days later it exploded even more. At most of those intervals, (1, 1.5, 2) taking profits would've been a loss. Now it would've been good to take profits at the top, but nobody could predict that. That's why I prefer to just buy a coin which I feel strongly in, and then just hold it until... well I haven't figured out when to sell. I'll figure it out ig.",1640819715,hqh2k7e

"With all the hubbub earlier this year about GME I think their ""fanbase"" extends a little further than just gamers. Gamestop has also been leaning heavily into ""nerd culture"" collectibles since they acquired ThinkGeek in 2015. 

It only makes sense that GME would want to get in on digital collectibles, too. Assuming they are actually partnered with Loopring they're probably going to try to become what Veve is to ImmutableX, basically a go-between with major brands like Disney and an underlying rollup service. Gamestop creates the trading platform (or partners with LRC to do it) and then uses their existing brand relationships to get official NFT deals. Evidently there's demand for it, so Gamestop is moving to meet that demand regardless of what a few angry gamers on Reddit and Twitter think about it. 

&gt; Look into any post that mentions NFTs in a gaming sub and watch the hate flow.

Reddit gamers also hate pay-to-win and MTX, but P2W games are still incredibly popular and MTX is raking in millions. IDK how successful the Stalker NFTs would have been but there's absolutely a market for game NFTs. There's way more overlap in the NFT and gaming communities than Reddit would have you believe.",1640793943,hqf8f71

Loopring - holding at about +700%, I think I peaked at around 1200% when it pumped

Nucypher - was up 900% everywhere but coinbase, sold while it was at 350% on coinbase and would have been 650% on any other exchange - also couldn’t transfer off of coinbase to sell elsewhere (8+ hour pending transaction times)

You’re comparing an entire sidechain going down to individual services relying on an OPTIONAL service that can be mitigated by running their own nodes.

Otherwise, you're left with the same solution that exists now: use L2s. Entry into them still requires a one-time full price fee and they're not fully matured yet, but they've already seen a hefty reduction in gas prices, with specialised ZK rollups in particular (Loopring, zkSync, dYdX) seeing over 20x reduction in gas fees *at the least.*

L2s are the only short term solution that should scale massively in the long term, and after the merge comes data sharding, which should drive gas prices down further, doubly so for rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, etc, *not* Polygon).

"Not exactly a noob but a hodler, of some minor btc since 2014 and altcoins since 2016/17. Could you expand on this a bit, or give some advice on how this sort of exchange can help solve a problem I have? 

The issue: like many, I'm trying to xfer binance wallet coins to US wallets that support said coins. I've gotten the most valuable stuff off, but all my loopring is on binance, and I don't really want to pay the 50% LRC exchange rate to move it (seems a waste to lose half of my current best performing alt coin, even if we're only talking about twenty bucks in value). It looks like binance is going to charge that rate even to move it to binance.us (other trades did not have their exchange fee refunded despite selecting that option). 

I have a ton of TRX. Could I convert the LRC into TRX, transfer the TRX to a us supporting wallet (thinking metal for instance), then convert back to LRC? Even binance.us doesn't support TRX so it's not an option. Thanks for any help you can provide.",1609862745,gi6vi2s
"The L2 ball has already been picked up is being carried across the finish line as we speak.

Right now you can try Ethereum layer 2s on Mainnet. There's [Loopring](https://loopring.io/) and [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), which are zk-Rollups, so have all of the security guarantees of Ethereum Mainnet, immediate settlement and 1000X lower fees than Mainnet transactions.

You can also use the [xDai Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/) and [Matic Network](https://matic.network/), which are more centralized than ZK-Rollups, and lack their ironclad security guarantees, but are even more scalable, and have full EVM-compatibility.

Then there are Optimistic Rollups, the first of which, [Fuel Network](https://fuel.sh/), has launched, and provides highly decentralized scaling for basic value transfer transactions through a UTXO model, while others, including [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) and [Arbitrum](https://offchainlabs.com/), are near launch, and will provide EVM compatibility, with 100X the scalability, and at the cost of a delayed withdrawal from L2 process.",1609861730,gi6tayh

"I’ve personally used Loopring and what you and everyone else forgets to mention is that you still need to pay hefty gas fees to go from L1 to L2, and again from L2 to L1. So yes, you can transact very cheaply with your L2 ETH but for most use cases you still need L1 ETH at some point.",1609814064,gi4zg2a

What about loopring ?,1609806172,gi4k138
"Ah yes, sorry, and welcome to crypto! Its all pretty confusing, I know...

Layer 2 means that transactions are not written directly to the blockchain (which might be overcrowded, or slow, or expensive), but they are collected, and only e.g. a checksum of many transactions is written to the base chain.
This gives an enormous boost in transaction speed, and throughput in tps, and still keeps the security of the blockchain.

So on Ethereum, the busiest blockchain by far (where also loopring lives), scalability in the near future comes on layer 2, and in the further future additionally by an upgrade of the blockchain itself (Ethereum 2.0).

"Lol XLM is a solid coin. Also it doesn’t lack liquidity. It is also the most used blockchain when it comes to transaction volumes. Second, Denelle Dixon, former CEO of Mozilla and current CEO of STELLAR spoke at IMF conference for the role of XLM or Stellar in cross-border payments. The recent protocol upgrade of Stellar makes it so so much easier to onboard noobs. 4% XLM cashback debit card by Coinbase is this month. USDC is also coming to it on Feb 2021 making USDC transactions cheaper and faster. 

Bitcoin has been mostly up because it is the most established crypto not gonna lie. But I also look for what Bitcoin can’t solve. Bitcoin fee is high. Lightning doesn’t seem to be a good solution. Still, I don’t believe that Bitcoin would be killed by any alts.

However, to tokenize BITCOIN on STELLAR is huge. Because you will avoid high transaction fees. Smart contract is being worked on this year on Stellar.

You can’t compare XVG to XLM or to Loopring.

Also, you say “you ride most of these alts for gains” sounds so BTC maxi. So let me ask you do you also just ride BTC for gains?

"What about Loopring? I don't mean to shill but after using Coinbase and Uniswap for a while and getting annoyed with the high gas / trading fees I tried Loopring wallet on my phone.

They have a layer 2 protocol that allows for almost free trading&gt; I think you pay 0.2% which gets shared with the stakeholders. The only downside is that you have to pay gas fees to get your tokens onto Layer 2. The fee is about the same as a regular UNiswap trade though. It helps to pull your assets together on l1 and then do 1 big swap to l2. Also helps to do this whenever gas prices are low.

It's a lot of fun being able to trade quickly between assets without paying gas fees. Feel like the market is going down? Swap to a stable coin and buy back later. Or just put your tokens into a liquidity pool and earn mining and transaction fees.

"ETH is a platform which allows other developers to build apps on it (dapps - decentralised apps), currently has the high gas fee due to scaling issue - ETH 2.0 is hoping to resolve this. 


Competitors - ADA, DOT, ATOM, SOL. But many beyond this are competing for L2 (LRC, MATIC etc) ETH is very much ahead of the game in terms of first mover and the number of developers working on it, even though some other platforms are creating 'better' systems than where ETH started/may be now


Swaps - 1inch, UNI, Sushi - as you say. But any ethereum swap app is going to deal with high gas fees. I would suggest looking at Centralised exchanges if you want to purchase tokens - if you go to coingecko, the coins page will have its available exchanges and pairs listed on it. That can be a good starting point.


Layer 2 solutions - like Loopring (LRC) and ETH 2.0 when it launches resolve the high gas fees.


If you have to use gas - for now check on gasnow.org to see the current gas fee needed to send a transaction - apps like metamask and uniswap tend to overstate it a little, so this can save you a little bit in fees should you need to use ETH based swaps",1612108442,glhm2lm

"I have a free wholesome reward I'd like to use to bribe someone who can guide me in the right direction/answer my question. I'm too much of a dummy to figure this out on my own and I don't want to mess up any staking rewards I could potentially receive so here it goes.   


I started staking my LRC 3 months ago, if you're unfamiliar with their staking, it requires you to lock your tokens in for a minimum of 3 months before you can claim staking rewards, from there you can either continue staking with your tokens + the staking reward tokens or, withdraw your funds + the rewards entirely. During the staking period, it shows updated data such as accumulated rewards and token age. Fast forward a couple of months and they upgrade to V2 then begin to start advertising Loopring AMM Liquidity Mining which is basically staking on V2 (from my understanding).   


Here's where my confusion occurred, I couldn't un-stake from V1 because my tokens were locked for another 15-20 days. At the time my staking rewards were still pending so I thought all was well and I'd migrate once I literally could. I noticed about 10 days before my tokens became unlocked that claiming and staking for V1 was disabled and my reward balanced dropped from X amount to 0. I'm fairly certain it did not get added to my staked balanced either.   


Did I just get super unlucky with my timing and I'm now SOL or is there a way to get rewards for the past 3 months of staking?",1612066996,glg3tak

There have been multiple leaks from GitHub which connect GameStop to loopring, and beyond that, Matthew Finestone moved from a top position on the loopring team to an ethereum blockchain related position within GameStop. 

It is believed that this level of adoption is what will bring millions of gamers to blockchain, and loopring will be the platform on which they arrive.

It two separate transactions (3 and 7 days ago) on my Loopring wallet it cost me 192 LRC to move 1ETH and 457 LRC from L1 to L2 and then to a AMM liquidity pool

At the moment I've made $9.51 from the pool. I've seen the APR for LRC/ETH go from 28% to 8% to right now 48.77%

Can someone smarter than me tell me when I can potentially break even? I'm guessing its 12 - 15 months

Theory 1. GitHub commits regarding the LRC Counterfactual Wallet being almost ready for launch. 

It was mentioned on the official Loopring Discord that the counterfactual wallet will be announced just before or simultaneously with the NFT partner announcement. Which means that the time to announcement could be any day now. 


Theory 2. The gag order for Ryan Cohen of GameStop, ends on 23rd November. So people might be buying up LRC in a way to prepare for a probably announcement that he might make now that the gag order is lifted. 

So let's see where this train goes, if the announcement does happen, it's gonna take off. 

Will be a lot of fun to see what happens if there is radio silence from LRC and GME today.

"The Loopring wallet has the ability to set up ‘guardians’ but I have zero idea how this works. To be fair, I haven’t gotten that far yet. 

I about died trying to set up the wallet at all. It’s not super duper user friendly for people who dk what they are doing. I am new to everything crypto in general, and I had a scary time figuring out how to set it up. Still not sure how to load it up with anything besides LRC or ETH. I will figure it out. It really is ‘free’ gas to move everything on L2. Transferring from Coinbase only costs whatever the fees were on cb’s end (I think?) but it didn’t cost anything else. I moved $25 of ETH to my wallet from Coinbase that they had essentially held hostage there bc I didn’t have enough gas to move it. If I am correctly understanding what just happened here? Bc I’ve been trying to move small amounts of crypto from my Coinbase exchange to my Coinbase wallet and wasn’t allowed to bc of gas fees. But the Loopring wallet lets me do bc I deployed the layer 2 option. 

Does anyone know if I can move more than LRC and ETH to this wallet? I feel like a complete moron with it.",1638497217,hn0j14v

"Yea, since you're downvoting every comment that doesn't agree with you anyways, here's my last one: as any crypto investment, it's high risk. The first github leak wasn't commented on by the devs. Since then, some shills tried to produce more ""leaks"" on github, which got denied promtly by the devs.

Your red flags aren't really anything, since they solely build on random assumtions, just like the points you're criticising. Fact is, we only know that some NFT marketplace is being build, their wallet is getting an upgrade, it's an opensource zkRollup (next to zksync, starkware, polygon), and they're working on zkEVM with the EF (just like zksync, starkware, and polygon), and they _hope_ to have something ready to show in q4--NOT the q4 report (worth 10 quarterly reports, as teased by the lead dev).

If you want a real point to worry about, it should be the bad english translations ending up in Loopring's products atm (seems like no real proof reading, when translating from chinese). And obviously that every competitor is slightly ahead with zkEVM. Loopring isn't the holy grail, but at this stage, it surely looks like yahoo in the 90s.",1638457318,hmxs62n
"Loopring is just one zkRollup amoung several available. What do you think makes it better or more important than zkSync, StarkNet, Hermez etc? Comparing LoopRing to Hermez's implementation of ZK rollups the most obvious difference is that Loopring has a centralized block producer (https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/blob/master/packages/loopring_v3/contracts/core/impl/ExchangeV3.sol#L315-L322) who could extract all the MEV from transactions on chain if they so wished, whereas Hermez has a decentralized auction based system to decide who produces blocks: https://docs.hermez.io/#/developers/protocol/consensus/consensus?id=forging-consensus-protocol, which seems to me a sensible way to avoid the risks associated with having trusted parties.

With regard to Gamestop, they have a marketcap of about $15.5 billion (https://ycharts.com/companies/GME/market_cap), which sounds like a lot, but there are multiple dApps that have more than that locked in DeFi... AAVE has around $15.6 billion locked into it's platform and Curve has about $21.5 billion (https://defillama.com/protocol/aave and https://defillama.com/protocol/curve respectively).

There are talks of an ""announcement"", regarding the NFT marletplace. Assuming it's Gamestop, they'll just launch it as any other product and announce it accordingly. I doubt that they're even mentioning Loopring. Why would they. Since when does a product launch involve marketing information about the code it's written with.

The ""announcement"" that's worth 10 quarterly reports is in fact the q4 report of Loopring. And as I said above, that only can happen after q4 has ended.

"Nothing official, biggest update is probably the Loopring CEO being directly asked about it in an interview and replying ""I cant comment on that"".

"Here's a train award for you lmayo

I've been in crypto since 2017 and own both Loopring and Gamestop. I think this is a wonderful example of crypto merging into the real world and I am super hyped about what they're gonna do. Gaming and crypto/NFTs offer so many opportunities, I might faint if I continue",1638445301,hmx5rsr

"Either ETH gets great 2nd layer scaling complete with full sharding and atomic composability or it slowly but surely dies.

There are far better digital ledger tech based networks that could flip ETH.

But ETH has network effect so it might survive and work alongside the new DLT platforms.

I hope it does survive because it could tank the whole crypto bourse if it suddenly dies and I am sure Vitalik wants to keep this thing going. I still like ETH with zkRollups and Optimism. Right now the gas fees really suck. But stuff like Loopring and Polygon are helping out big time.",1638438104,hmwwyk3

Even if you think your technical analysis is 100% correct, next minute theres China FUD, theres another coronavirus, india bans crypto, US releases dumb regulations and it destroys your portfolio. 

Take this as someone who has literally down 66% of their portfolio at one point which was about 20k AUD loss. Then I made it all back by just leaving it in loopring. 

Which leads to the final point which is just buy and HOLD. Forget about it for the next month. Focus on your life, exercise, relationships, diet, career and hobbies. ANYTHING BUT CRYPTO.",1638423540,hmwdesw

Loopring (despite all the attention it gets here), Optimism, and Diversify are not even close the largest Layer 2 platforms.

"I've heard that ETH update will lower gas fees by about 80% but that's still expensive. That's cutting $300 gas down to $60 gas. When you compare $60 tx fee to other layer 1 platforms with $0.0017 tx fees, it's still not fully resolved, but getting there. The other issue is that the gas fee reduction will likely be done by increasing block size. Larger blocks &gt; fewer fees &gt; lower fees. But that also means slower transaction completion, because more data must be processed per block. There's always a give and take. Layer 2 solutions right now seem like the faster and cheaper way to go, but lack the impressive decentralization of the Ethereum blockchain. Just as secure and faster and cheaper—but somewhat centralized. And I may even have to roll back that first ""just as secure"" point: being more centralized leads to a big target on the network, and could be *less* secure than it seems. Hard to mess with a network with 3100+ nodes (Ethereum). Not sure how many Loopring has, but typically layer 2s don't have as many",1638415291,hmvxbo4

"I mentioned this before but the market launch has been announced to launch Q4 of this year, 2021. I'm really excited to see how LRC grows and how it affects the NFT/gaming world.  


**Path Forward**

1. **NFT Marketplace**  
As mentioned above, we are working with an established partner who is building atop our newly released L2 NFT functionality. We are very excited to share more on this as soon as we can. This new marketplace is set to launch sometime prior to the end of 2021(Q4).

[https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-quarterly-update-2021-q3-bd083d94ca17](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-quarterly-update-2021-q3-bd083d94ca17)",1638402908,hmv4uaj

"Partnerships are one thing and I'm bullish on the Loopring protocol, but does the LRC token have actual utility or does it just kind of... exist?",1638400264,hmuz0zy
"GameStop announced early this year they are shifting toward blockchain focus, and making an NFT marketplace. This is anticipated to bring millions of their members into the crypto space, and their partnerships with game developers will likely accelerate the inevitable shift from normal in-game micro transactions to NFTs that you actually own. Not much information has been given from GameStop yet, other than they have a dedicated blockchain team and they have a webpage NFT.GameStop.com. 

On the flip side, loopring (LRC) are a layer 2 eth scaling protocol who we know to be working with a “premium partner” to help them launch their NFT marketplace. Leaked GitHub code has revealed that it is GameStop, but this hasn’t been made official yet. Loopring have given a Q4 date for this announcement.",1638400032,hmuyise

Loopring layer-2 scaling solution is exactly what the market looking for.,1639241814,ho50knw
"I'm really hoping the anticipated free Loopring wallet will help out with this but you're totally right about the current state.

The whole ""just use L2"" argument seems disingenuous at this point where L2 bridges are super expensive. With that said, L2 chains are slowly being integrated into exchanges so the future looks bright",1639240219,ho4wr6u
"So people are generally talking about ethereum with this stuff, although I'm sure other chains can have similar solutions. Ethereum is layer one and then other things built on top of it like loopring and polygon are layer 2. It's a means of scaling the main chain. You've probably heard lots of talk about ethereum having insanely high transaction fees. This is because there is a limited amount of space for transactions in every block that is published. This is where a layer 2 comes in. A layer 2 can process a ton of different people's transactions at once, compress them, and then submit them to layer 1 in this much more compact form and save everyone a ton of gas fees.",1639239696,ho4vitd
"I was thinking the same think, until I actually used Ethereum for Defi. I  had to pay like hundreds of dollars of that to gas fees, and it was extremely slow. Etherscanner was showing that it should be a couple dollars, but the cost for interacting with stuff like Uniswap was way higher.

So right now I have like a couple grand sitting in Metamask under Ethereum that I can't do anything with because it'll cost me hundreds of dollars to move my shit.

People say that layer 2 solutions will fix this, but getting into layer 2 is still extremely expensive. You to pay a ton for the bridge to polygon, often &gt;$100. I tried out Loopring yesterday, and just even creating a wallet cost $124 due to the Gas fees.

So anytime I actually use Ether, it further radicalizes me.",1639237370,ho4q7es

Exactly. I was considering investing in MATIC but decided not to since they bought MIR. They seem to recognize that they can't get it done on their own and are hoping some other company can. It's kind of late to be buying another L2 after getting Hermez. I think Starkware and Loopring are far ahead.,1639224479,ho426mg

"i'm pretty confident 80% of those have only heard about Loopring once or twice up until the GME leak, and now suddenly LRC is THE solution to etherything (not funny, i know). I guess they just don't even know there's different rollups existing already. Loopring didn't have a lot going for it for the past two years. Meanwhile, IMX is sitting at 3.7k subs and even tanking while $Gods is running upwards. People just see that one NFT game but have no clue of the underlaying protocols, which hints at the level of 'research' being done on L2 solutions, i assume.

That said, LRC, Arbitrum and Optimism aim to do different/more things than Immutable, it's (currently, at least) fully focused on NFTs. 

Patiently waiting for a StarkWare token announcement. It would be huge.",1639219905,ho3vung

It validates that Loopring are playing in the right spot - but who wins in a decade, nobody knows.",1639219784,ho3vott
"There is an important differentiation here between MATIC token and Polygon chain. Polygon's various zk projects are solid, I have no problem using them and they do amazing stuff decongesting Eth. But their 'Binance-model' scaling solution and token reserves incurs risk to **MATIC holders**, but not necessarily **Polygon network users**. 

This approach is good on the one hand as it can fund acquisitions and R&amp;D on zk solutions (completely trustless), plus it expands lucrative marketing. But it's still prone to network outage and attacks on its sidechain portion. While you can exit perfectly fine if using the L2 rollups, which remains committed to Ethereum, MATIC price will still take a hit and could sow distrust.

This is why Loopring is blockchain agnostic and is segregated into specific tokens for each respective chain (i.e. LRC for Ethereum, LRQ for Qtum, and LRN for Neo). They develop mostly on Eth of course. I think Polygon needs better compartmentalisation.",1639217135,ho3s9wn
"Why does it need a separate token? And assuming Loopring is open source, couldn’t a developer team eventually clone it replace LRC for ETH?",1639216790,ho3rtnj

"Starkware uses it’s own programming language called Cairo, and then intends to have it translated into the zkEVM.  I’m not a programmer, but this seems to have an extra layer of complexity that can make 100% compatibility difficult.  They’ve also had their fair share of criticism in the early days for calling their program a zkRollup, when it didn’t even store the application metadata on-chain, but they’ve fixed that since.   Still not a great look

Loopring is working with Ethereum and using Ethereum’s native Solidarity language for their zkEVM, which seems to be the correct move.  Loopring has been was the first to work on zkRollups, starting something like 6 years back.

"To power lrc nodes? I don’t think you can. It works on a proof of stake. So you can stake for interest and in doing so you help secure the network. You also have to stake lrc to host an exchange. I’m almost positive neither can be done with Eth.

If no one stakes lrc then there’s no nodes, no layer 2 available. It’s in the interest of anyone planning on regularly using the service to stake to help secure it. Plus the interest is a motivator.   So let’s say you want to buy some nfts from game stop, it’ll probably be in your best interest to make sure the network you buy them on stays up and running lest you’re forced back into Eth fees in the future when they cost who knows how much. I’ve been asked for 1600$ just to approve a token on Eth before. I’ve seen entire months where a transaction wasn’t less than 200$ where as loopring makes the fees negligible and allows Eth to run at an acceptable speed as opposed to a transaction dropping piece of slow, dated crap.",1639187442,ho2egm5

If I am wrong then so be it, but I believe they’ll create more uses for the token as time goes on, and I’m not upset that you don’t “need” to hold loopring to use their protocol. Seems quite properly in the spirit of decentralization. 

You don’t “need” pancake swap, or uniswap, or sushi… yet those tokens and platforms have all done surprisingly well.

How many tokens are literally a pyramid scheme with no utility at all other than staking for interest that comes from unlimited minting and still go 100x? Lrc crushes most non native tokens ive seen.

Moreover, all transactions on Loopring collect minimal fees (not ETH gas) and guards against DoS attacks which is common with zero fee blockchains. LRC is also set to be deflationary.

LRC and its underlying zk tech is the final puzzle to the DeFi promise we envisioned with bitcoin and ethereum. Loopring is the green revolution, your personal recoverable bank/vault, and patent office (via free NFT minting) all in your pocket.",1639182778,ho241lw

"Easy to understand breakdown here. 

https://beincrypto.com/learn/loopring-lrc/

It fixes every problem that is holding back ethereum from mass adoption. 

1: Fixes gas fees, speed without sacrificing security - Loopring packages 4000 transactions per second via a process called a zero knowledge rollup (zkrollup) on the ethereum blockchain, which currently only can utilize 15 transactions per second. This will reduce fees to operate on the blockchain by minimum 30x, likely 200x.

2: Is the building block upon which NFT and other marketplaces will be built. Have a premium partner (likely gamestop) who will be announcing something this quarter (next 3 weeks)

3: Will operate their own DEX (decentralized exchange) with direct fiat onramps. Meaning you deposit from your debit card/bank account to its level 2 wallet, and pay incredibly low fees (~3%). And you OWN THE KEYS, meaning you are your own bank. This has never happened before, and its game-changing.",1639169082,ho177vw
"* Loopring is a DEX Protocol. It allows for open building of DEXs (inclusive of dApps who want to use DEX architecture) and then uses a 'ring-order' solution to route orders in the L2 (order matching). \[1\]
* LRC is used to pay 'ring-miners' (who are routing the orders) and for governance.  \[2\]

Here's the whitepaper: [https://loopring.org/resources/en\_whitepaper.pdf](https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf)

"Matic has a solid future. But its a sidechain that sacrificies security (its not L1 ethereum, the gold standard) for speed and cost. Once speed and cost and fixed by zkrollups like Loopring, there will be no need for sidechains.",1639167135,ho1291e
Anything related to Crypto.com and Loopring is the current trend.,1639166813,ho11g87
"Good comment. Personally, I think mass adoption won't come until the masses don't ever consider what is L1 or L2. Its going to need fiat onramps directly to L2, and with keys. At that point, you are your own bank. I think Loopring should be done with both of these by the end of the month.",1639166753,ho11arl
"Faster exits and trustless security in zkRollups. The only edge optimistic rollups have is their EVM compatibility, which allows any dApp to easily deploy on them. But most zk projects are implementing this. There’s high expectations with Loopring working with the Ethereum Foundation (founded by Eth creator, Vitalik) on their zkEVM

Loopring also comes with its native mobile wallet and DEX. The NFT marketplace announcement is expected amongst a stack of other updates including a free L2 Wallet, direct fiat to L2 on/off-ramps, Arbitrum L1/L2 Wallet launch (gas fee reduction), Ethereum EIP4488 (optimised for rollups), Grayscale listing (already shortlisted), DAO assembly and voting (potential for staking and token burns), zkEVM (general construction for any app to build on Loopring).",1639166564,ho10tri

There’s no exact “dead project” criteria. Bitconnect, One Coin, and squid coin were all scams, so I suppose those could make the cut.

Other projects that were once large and hopeful were projects like XVG and NEM.  They’re not so much dead as they are not n life support.

Doge keeps coming back stronger every cycle.

Looking at the Loopring LRC chart, maybe this would meet your standards?

It wasn’t so much “dead” as it was a bear market and nearly everyone just lost interest in the space.  The ADA chart looks similar.",1639166075,ho0zkse

"MATIC is very different. Polygon is working on multiple scaling solutions.  
 Polyong sidechain (most used atm) is comparable to the Binance Smart Chain, a more centraliced EVM blockchain. It's cheap and fast but you don't have the security of Ethereum.  
They also have two live zk rollups (Miden and Hermez) which are more comparable to LRC. They have more rollups in development.
LRC is a permissioned  (not everyone can release an app on LRC)  zk rollup. Loopring released its first version in Dec 2017 which is quite a long time for a zk rollup.",1639165271,ho0xkp0

"Oh boy, I went big in on Loopring back in February, but ended up converting it all to ADA shortly after. In the current, I am kicking myself. In the future, I don't think I will be paying attention to the price of LRC. Big ugh.",1639163882,ho0u48o
"LRC is and always has been an excellent project, but just to maintain some perspective, keep in mind that there are currently *at least* 19 different L2s on Ethereum, of which Loopring is just one. Loopring is currently the 4th biggest L2 in terms of TVL (total value locked, so basically a usage metric). They currently have about 10% of the TVL of all L2s. They have been around longer than basically every single other L2 (take that as you will). 

So, LRC is great, and very useful, but it is just one of many similar projects. It is one of 14 different rollup L2s, and one of 7 zk rollup L2s (or if you also count Validium L2s, which are very similar to zk rollups, then it is one of 10).

Also, keep in mind that none of this includes side chains like Polygon. Polygon currently has 80% as much TVL as *all the 19 L2s combined*. It is also much faster and much, much, much cheaper than any L2, regardless of if we're talking about optimistic rollups, zk rollups, validium, or plasma L2s. Transactions on Polygon are a tiny fraction as expensive as even transactions on LRC. Of course, the catch is that side chains are not true extensions of L1s; they are just emulators, and don't benefit from L1 security. So, Polygon has to provide its own (much weaker) security, while L2s benefit from Ethereum's robust L1 security.

Personally, I think L2s will eventually beat out sidechains for the reasons stated in the paragraph above (despite being way more expensive than sidechains; at least we'll eventually get L1 sharding to shrink that gap). And I also think that rollups are the type of L2 that will continue to dominate for the foreseeable future. And of the two types of rollups, I think zk has a much brighter future (just a lot harder to implement, which is why zk rollup platforms are moving a lot slower than optimistic rollup platforms, and why still nobody has created a true ZKEVM). 

So, I do think LRC has a good shot at a bright future. It is the second largest (by TVL) of the 7 zk rollup L2s that exist, and while zk rollups currently hold a pretty tiny slice of DeFi, I think they are the technology that will emerge more and more as the ideal Ethereum scaling solution. Since LRC is the most OG and second biggest of the 7 zk rollup platforms, then it's a pretty good bet as an investment, especially if you agree with my take that L2s are the future of scaling, rollups are the future of L2s, and zk rollups are the future of rollups.

So sure, I'm bullish on LRC, but it would be pretty disingenuous to act like it is the main (or only) major player in the Ethereum scaling scene. How to scale Ethereum has been the central tech challenge of the entire blockchain world for over 4 years now. Dozens of teams and thousands of cutting edge devs and researchers have been working on solving this issue for years; nothing else is being worked upon as hard in the entire crypto world. And I promise that LRC is far from the only thing (or even most significant thing) that this tremendous effort has produced over the years.",1639163368,ho0sunl

MATIC is the third most used smartchain, right behind BSC and Ethereum.

"When you're talking about L2's, then Matic shouldn't even be in that category. Polygon is a sidechain. It's never going to be a real L2. They realised this and were behind, hence why they bought Hermez and Mir. 

You're right about Arbitrum being ahead when it comes to L2's, but let's are honest, optimistic rollups (Arbitrum, optimism, etc.) or any of the plasma or sidechains are great for the short term but long term? Zk's will edge out once these foundations figure out an efficient, more reliable way to get these zk's to be EVM compatible. 

If I'm going to be completely honest? I have more faith in Loopring, Starkware, and Matter Labs to advance ZK tech further than Polygon. In my eyes, all polygon did was buy 2 startup ZK L2's and barely start to develop Zk of their own. They'll always be behind",1640025610,hpbprs6

Let me spell it out for you all using Elon as the example since you brought him up. He has basically no income, so he pays no tax. He has always paid himself instocks.

As the scale of users grows on Loopring L2, Loopring relayer needs to be expanded and upgraded to better serve these new users.

So does this mean that people at Loopring are just building the marketplace and have nothing to do with it after that and GameStop will issue its own tokens without Loopring? Is Loopring using the hype to push up the price of LRC when it isn't going to be used or is GameStop actually going to use LRC as tokens in their NFT marketplace?

Side note: Matt Finestone and Ryan Cohen go way back according to Reddit sleuths which is the reason why he was brought on.

Seeing as they promise a gasfee-less DEX with a direct fiat on/off-ramp that seems quite believable, but it won't happen overnight. If it is as good as everyone says then it will still take time before people start using it. As of right now it's barely in the top 30 of decentralized exchanges by volume, but trading every ERC-20 token with no gas fees seems like it should at least move up. 

And then there's the GME hype, but that doesn't actually have any direct impact on the price of the token. It's very good marketing though. Loopring is building the marketplace on their technology but the actual token serves no purpose there (correct me if I'm wrong).

The GameStop partnership will change the game, but it’s not the End Game for LoopRing. Once they prove they can host a massive partner like GME, many others will follow. Each company that wants to use the Protocol, will have to lock up a minimum of 250,000 LRC liquidity to operate. This is going to have a massive impact on Price,

The long term plan for loopring is to allow people to be completely independent of the current banking system or stock market. LRCs NFT wallets will allow companies to sell “stocks” as NFTs and circumvent hedge funds or shorts. You’ll be able to legitimately invest in products you believe in while minimizing risk. They are also adding fiat on and off ramps to their smart wallet and producing a counterfactual wallet allowing L2 trades and purchases which keeps consumers from having to transfer from L1 to L2 making gas fees negligible. Direct deposit will also be available. They have also partnered with Eidoo letting you use a debit card that is connected with your smart wallet to make purchases.

From my experience, there's no reason to leave L2 if you just want to trade between USDC and LRC (or other tokens) especially with off-ramps from L2 coming.

"Not LRC . I was talking generally in terms of avoiding ETH. Do see Uniswap has LRC listed on polygon, but no liquidity right now. Could keep an eye out .

Until then your best bet is going to have to be USDC direct in Loopring app , then to a CEX to sell or if there’s a way to offboard to fiat from ETH then bridge to ETH then off-board to fiat. 

Thinking about it, it usually costs the sending blockchains gas for the bridge. So onboarding to ETH should be cheap as it would be paid from Loopring side. It’s offboard thats expensive from eth .",1640762979,hqdvayd

What really strikes me is that GS has pulled in top talent from companies like Amazon into their leadership. These are people making money hand over first at their jobs and they left that for GameStop.  Here’s the kicker. By and large, these people are all being paid purely in GS stock for compensation. Whatever roadmap they’ve been shown for the future of the company, it’s impressive enough to poach dozens of high level people from some of the most successful companies in the world and they’re taking stock only.

Last week we also saw a lot of job listings for the GameStop NFT team pointing to web3 gaming and also a lot of hype in the listings basically saying that you would be building thing which generated billions of revenue.

I think it's plausible that a large number people see it the way you put it because they have no idea what Layer1 &amp; Layer2 are. And they think Eth2 is sort of like moving from testnet to mainnet. Could also be tied to the rise of Loopring since they are the leading ZK project right now. We'll see what happens I suppose.,1637290882,hl7gsv6
"I like this write up a lot. DeFi has already changed the world of finance for so many but clearly the space has a lot of growing up to do.

Between BSC having apparent issues even keeping its validator nodes synced, Matic not being a true L2 and most solutions not having meaningful liquidity there is much yet to be done.

I know Hermez might be Polygon networks saviour in that department, but my point being it all has lots of growing up to do.

Personally I think there are a lot of great projects looking to solve many of the problems that exist in defi today.

Loopring, dYdX and ZK Swap are my favorites as of yet, but Loopring really does a lot more atm.
What's not to like? Swaps, order book, NFT's and even working with the ethereum foundation for general purpose  ZK EVM is huge... Liquidity on the protocol is doing well also.

L2 is certainly a huge step forward and working solutions are available today.

I seriously hope people catch on soon and start ditching L1 services due to slow speeds, low throughput and insane gas fees. 

I hope in 12 months a significant portion of Ethereum users no longer interact with L1 at all.",1637290533,hl7g19z
"from what i'm hearing, loopring is working on a system where you make a one time payment for a wallet and then everything traded from that wallet is subject to insanely low gas fees (less than 1$) i could be totally misunderstanding these rumours but thats what ive heard.  There is a suspicious amount of fud going around against nft's (and LRC) at the moment.",1637290416,hl7fs18

"Gas sucks, can't be improved upon fast enough. No doubt about it.

If you do need to transact on eth then paying the damned gas fee to get to L2 is essential, if you want to make moves do it soon. If you don't need anything to happen right now wait to we see gas fees of under 50 gwei again.

Deposit to loopring L2 and leave gas fees behind. Its only a matter of time until L2 bridges go directly to centralised exchanges and other services that traditionally require L1 transactions.

You don't need to wait for the counterfactual wallet. You don't need to spend 500 bucks on the gas fee for deploying their smart contract wallet.
Just go to their site, connect using wallet connect or metamask and deposit to access the L2 ecosystem. Swaps, order book trades, liquidity mining and soon NFT market place all on L2 with no gas fees.

Got a hardware wallet? No problem! Connect it to metamask and use metamask to access L2. 

Please be aware you pay the platform a tiny fee for transfers and of course the swap fees which again is nothing compared anything happening on L1.

A bit preachy, but please join the future of DeFi on L2 before shit gets even worse regarding gas costs.",1637271447,hl690fm

"Fortune favors the brave. I'm not sure there's a ""safer"" speculative play on the market today. Outside of the *strong* leads that are posted over on LoopringOrg and SuperStonk it has other favorable angles to pitch on. 

They've got an active dev team that appears to believe in the platform and are in it for the long haul. Everything you want if you're looking at a tokens fundamentals.. LRC is currently on the smaller side of being a mid-cap token  so the room to grow is there. MATIC (polygon) has a market cap of 10 billion which is also a Layer-2 Etherium solution. This is the reasonable floor that I see LRC achieving if they continue without a partnership with GameStop. 

I'm here though because I saw the connections between GameStop and Loopring and felt like I couldn't miss this opportunity. New leadership with a modern vision of the company, continuously taking top talents from tech companies (**MULTIPLE**Amazon VP's, one of Looprings own, and postings for other Blockchain positions that they're wanting to create and fill).

"I don't think it will simply be a jpeg sale either. Loopring recently added NFTs but before that they were mostly focused on smart contract wallets, wallet integration and swap markets. These are the perfect products for a  Steam like game market but with the added benefit of swaps and secondary sales. 

You buy a game, you receive an NFT in wallet and if that wallet contains the NFT associated with the game, it will allow you to play said game. This is just a digitized version of their current business model but less broken and way less overhead. They can just charge a small fee for swaps / sales rather than offer some shit trade in price. 

It just opens up so many possibilities. They will get so much more customer engagement if the platform has halfway competent social features.",1637252358,hl4wk8f

Yes; it is still entirely speculation but with some damn solid leads (like the GitHub links before).
Even if it’s not GME, they’re announcing a major marketplace with a partner in Q4 and half the ‘apes’ know this, so will likely stay around even if it’s not GameStop. 

I think the only thing that will limit it is a poor rollout of the marketplace, and an alternative L2 solution gets true utility before Loopring. Time will tell but it’s hard not to be bullish when I got in for less than £0.35.",1637251939,hl4viqk

"Hmmmm... no, not right now.

Imo Polygon is trash ok, im just talking about it here because the guy made a comparison to it.

But have you heard about Optimism/Arbitrum/Zksync??

Zksync will actually be the first EVM COMPATIBLE Zk rollup (basically the same tech behind loopring). Do you know how MASSIVE this is? having a single app with zkrollups is ""easy"", building an NFT marketplace with zkrollups is ""easy"". The problem with Loopring's L2 is that it's not EVM compatible, it's not a rollup where devs can simply copy/paste their apps onto. Heavy modifications have to be made to these smart contracts to have them be usable on a zkrollup like looprings. That also means that lrc's l2 is very limited. You are bound to only do on it what the loopring builds onto it, so a DEX and MAYBE at some point an nft marketplace. Sure, you will get free eth transfer and cheap swaps, thats GREAT! But you will also get that on zksync, you will also have that on Arbitrum/optimism (you already do). The problem is what you WON'T be able to do on loopring's L2. It lacks composability. You won't have your favourite L1 app on there. At some point (maybe just 1 year down the road), you will be able to do EVERYTHING on let's say Arbitrum's Layer 2 without EVER LEAVING IT! Because it will be a fully fleshed out ecosystem just like the Ethereum main layers is, you will even have fiat on and off ramps. You won't be able to do that on Loopring, like at all. You will be bound to hop between layers 2 if you absolutely want to use loopring, this will be costly.",1637249344,hl4p1nq

"It's more that the network has just ramped up to unprecedented levels of usage, that their fee structure wasn't designed to handle. Realistically, any L1 that is actually comparable to Ethereum (in that it's a smart contract chain that is capable of executing Turing-complete contracts) wouldn't be able to handle this level of usage well, either, at least without sacrificing decentralisation and/or security to meet the demand.

Most of the ""ETH killers"" fail at one of those two things: either they're not a smart contract chain (or they don't execute Turing complete contracts, which means their contracts aren't as capable as Ethereum's and so they can't really be compared directly), or they've sacrificed decentralisation and/or security to meet the demand (meanwhile Ethereum has stuck with remaining as decentralised and secure as it can possible be, despite the demand).

It's also worth mentioning that Ethereum isn't just accepting this, either, there *are* solutions in the works, some even available *right now.* The L1 chain will remain focused on decentralisation and security, but there will be a series of specialised L2 solutions that sit on top of the L1 chain (hence piggybacking off the security the L1 provides), that provide higher transaction throughput (meaning much cheaper fees) without sacrificing decentralisation, either.

The preferred L2 solution is rollups, which essentially process transactions off chain and then post already processed transaction data on chain in a compressed form, and then will either allow other users to contest the validity of the transactions (optimistic rollups), or will post proof of the validity of the transactions on chain alongside the transaction data (ZK rollups).

There are already implementations of both types of rollups available right now, with Optimism and Arbitrum being the two currently available optimistic rollups, and Loopring and ZKSync being the two currently available ZK rollups. You do need to pay a one-time full price fee to move your funds to a rollup, but once you're in a rollup, [you can enjoy transactions costing a fraction of what they'd cost on L1.][(https://l2fees.info/)

After the move to PoS, the next major upgrade to the Ethereum network will be data sharding, which basically replaces the single monolithic chain with many modular secondary/shard chains, essentially increasing the amount of data available to the network (without needing to raise the hardware requirements for nodes, which is how other L1 chains attempted to scale, which would lead to centralisation) while also allowing transactions to be processed on each shard in parallel. Shards should improve L1 throughput, which by extension will also improve L2 throughput, further driving gas fees down across the board.",1634965725,hhpm4ni

"I'll add something to what other people have mentioned about Loopring being a roll-up (it's also worth mentioning that Polygon is heavily invested in zkrollup technology via Polygon Hermez).  
  
Fundamentally, Polygon's vision is to build an ecosystem of products that allow people to scale, use, and develop on Ethereum. The most well known of these right now is the Polygon PoS chain.  
  
The Polygon PoS chain is built so that anyone can develop anything they'd like on it. It's a general purpose solution.  
  
Loopring takes a different approach. It's not open for anyone to develop on. They are building specific products on their protocol (e.g., the rumored GameStop NFT marketplace).

"You are both right … somehow.

_Loopring is a software running on Ethereum that aims to incentivize a global network of users to operate a platform that enables the creation of new types of crypto asset exchanges._

_One of an emerging number of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, Loopring uses multiple cryptocurrencies, including its own LRC cryptocurrency, to together provide for this platform._

_Most notably, Loopring claims its platform will allow exchanges built on top of it to sidestep the slow speeds and high costs associated with decentralized exchanges on Ethereum through the use of a newer type of cryptography called zero-knowledge rollups, or zkRollups._

With zkRollups, Loopring asserts its exchanges can offer faster settlements for traders. Rather than settling trades on the Ethereum blockchain directly (as other decentralized exchanges do), zkRollups enable Loopring exchanges to complete key computations elsewhere. 

The idea is that this can reduce the number of transactions that a Loopring exchange will need to submit to the Ethereum network, thus increasing speed and reducing costs for traders. 

This is in contrast to other decentralized exchanges, where trades require transactions to be confirmed by the Ethereum network, taking minutes instead of seconds or milliseconds.",1637613177,hlokvk1

Loopring (LRC) is a layer 2 solution for Ethereum. Meaning, it's built on top of Ethereum to help solve scalability issues. It uses a technology called Zero-knowledge Proof rollups or ZkP-rollups. 


What this means is, LRC tech is able to verify transactions without needing to know any information - i.e. how much the transaction is, where it is headed, etc. The rollup part is basically Loopring is able to execute transaction on layer 2(Loop) while also being able to post the transaction on layer 1(Eth)

I quote from loopring source [link](https://loopring.org/#/post/loopring-cto-steve-what-is-the-real-future-of-layer-2-networks)
&gt; Another new solution is a project being done by the Ethereum Foundation. In fact, Loopring is also participating in this project, which is just called “zkEVM”. Its idea is to directly compile the Solidity code into the byte code of the EVM without any translation, and directly execute the byte code in the virtual environment of zkEVM. Its virtual environment does the two biggest things. The first is to prove that the execution of byte code is correct, called EVM proof; the second is to prove that the modification of the world state is correct.


polygon source [link](https://blog.polygon.technology/seven-takeaways-from-polygon-hermez-fireside-chat/?utm_source=Twitter-Main&amp;utm_medium=Tweet&amp;utm_campaign=Tier-1-Announcement)
&gt;Polygon Hermez 2.0 will build upon the foundations laid by Hermez.  The main development goal is to launch a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, or zkEVM. This is a revolutionary approach that will recreate all the EVM opcodes using zero-knowledge technology, enabling smart contracts to be deployed on the ZK-Rollup.

"Maybe some perspective for the future price development of LRC:

My take on price prediction.

When reading the threads in this sub I stumble across a very broad range of price predictions. 
The following is just my take on the whole matter.
Since we’re all waiting for the official reveal of the GME partnership, maybe this puts it a bit in perspective.
To reach top 10 in terms of MC we would need to accumulate about 30 Billion Dollars. This would be 2x GMEs current MC.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmRlLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABsSwG_1_ZY8_yLtI9gNt0PDQV1gzHcsRzTJu9wjvSmnBW1yXoHtx8bteXvxBhUi1Qn2bz_VeOkeFnhOy9oe69JARgnre8Xa-DMbWkUFCzm0JC3QcMIrUQ-0AVz_4brCCwnig3CnDhYxs-K7LrpwxqdMcugfvC7JaFpM0LtYYGWh

Reaching top 10 seems quite manageable, taken the current growth rate in the last week into account. A MC of 30 Billion would mean a price per coin of about 24$.

This should be our price target … for the moment. 
But expecting it to blow up to 100, 200 or even 600$ by the end of the year is just crazy. 
Don’t get me wrong on this, off course I’d love to see those gains, but don’t fool yourself and be sad when it „only“ reaches 10 or 20$. Also take into account the massive sell off that’s going to occur at those prices. How many of those who spam „HODL“ in the comments really have the diamond balls required to don’t take gains and panic sell when a massive drop comes? 

Again, I myself expect a bright future for loopring, but this is no short term play. It might take years to reach a 100 Billion MC, not to speak of 500 Billion or more. 

So calm down, put your phone away for a few days and wait at least for the GME announcement. But don’t be sad if the price stagnates for a bit or even drops hard. As we all know, buy the rumours, sell the news. 
I’ve experienced something quite similar in may with Doge and Elon Musk appearing on SNL. Everybody expected Doge to skyrocket afterwards and what happened - the exact opposite. So plan your exit wisely and take gains on the way up.

Just my 2 cents, no financial advice and now go ahead and downvote into oblivion. 

TL;DR
24$ / coin in the next weeks might be a target, everything above is just pure luck and speculation.",1636572242,hk3tdgc

"Don't worry I got you.

Loopring is a Zero-knowledge proof rollup layer 2 scaling for Ethereum. 

One of the bigger reasons why it is pumping is due to GameStop's rumour about using Looprings new NFT Marketplace. 

Now on to ZkP-rollup

So Zero Knowledge proof is basically a protocol where one party tries to prove (prover) to another party (verifier) that something is true without telling them anything else. 

So on to Zk-Rollups - At the very essence, what LRC's tech does is group hundred of transactions together (or rollup transactions) into a single transaction as oppose to how MATIC who deals with it per transaction. The Zero Knowledge part comes during the rollup. LRC verifies each transaction without needing to know how much, who sent, who is receiving etc. Basically any important information will not be known but will still be verified.",1636568730,hk3kac0

"‘The buterin fellow’ never envisioned eth as a store of value, he saw it as a utility token. It was other eth holders aka governance who believed ‘eth is money’ and pushed forward on deflationary mechanics.

That said, even if they hadn’t, the Ethereum network is so popular that even without EIP1559 and the merge eth would still be expensive because there’s only so much block space. It’s sort of like Manhattan real estate, everyone wants in and the price is a function of that.

That said Vitalik and others in the space all see the issue of gas fees which is why there’s the huge push for layer 2s. In the not so distant future, most people will not even be using the main Ethereum chain, they will be using rollups because they are more efficient. Already online are Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Hermez. Soon to come are Miden and Loopring EVMs.

These chains are all secured by Ethereum, but because you are bundling transactions with a bunch of other people it’s much cheaper and quicker.

How can one estimate the value or potential value of there currency? With the stock market you are dividing up the ownership of a company making the value easier to understand. With a coin it doesn’t have any rhyme or reason that I can grasp. 

Like these coins that will be used to pay for things like hard drive storage for example. Okay so they charge X coins per TB/month. Fine I guess but what if the coin moons to $200. What does that even mean? People need to pay $200/month now or the charge gets reduced to a fraction of a coin? Wouldn’t that just make the coin a never changing value and just a matter of moving a meaningless decimal around?

"Ok I'll bite.

Loopring is at its core not a DEX, NFT platform or any single service.
It's a protocol designed to generate a relay mesh network of L2's who are completely trustless.

Sure, they currently only have one relayer which is run by Loopring themselves. It is in my eyes more of a proof of concept which shows exactly how a DEX and NFT platform with liquidity pools and a bunch of other services run on top of it can work. 

The real magic is getting others to run their own relayers with their own specialised services like is expected to happen with the entire GME situation. 
And every single one of these deployed relayers running their own services can talk to each other on L2 facilitating transfers of assets, NFT's of any kind for next to nothing compared to L1. 

First Loopring, now GME's NFT marketplace and who knows what's next? 
Point being, any entity who wants to build out a set of services on the biggest and fastest growing network of diverse assets and services in the world can do so whilst sharing liquidity through ring miners who match orders on the mesh network. 
This will completely eliminate the biggest barrier of entry for people who want to build their own marketplaces or other services on ethereum. 

GME doesn't work out? They abandon their stake of LRC locked in their platform and go bankrupt? No problem! 

As soon as the relayer stops submitting merkle proofs on L1 it's only a short wait until the smart contract on L1 puts the service in withdrawal mode and everyone can recover their assets directly on L1, no funds lost, no assets lost, no ruined lives. 

Sure... They built a proof of concept that is a great service in itself, but Loopring is laying the foundation of how you are going to transact on ethereum in the future.",1638069146,hmctesn

Is there a place where I can learn the jargon? I understand very little about markets in general, so I'm guessing a lot of that jargon comes from economics too, right?

"&gt; the fees are simply crazy. But we all know that. There was a lot of talk about this problem about Ethereum soon getting ""Layer 2"". Many people joked that it was coming ""soon"" for several years.

Blockchain have limited space in which to record transactions. The more a chain is used the more competition there is for blockspace. Ethereum fees are so high because the blocks are full, only Bitcoin and Ethereum have reached this barrier and both have chosen to scale using layer 2 solutions (Lightning and Rollups respectively).

Other chains either have less transactions to deal with (e.g. Litecoin and ETC) or sacrifice decentralization by having blocks so large that they chain can't be verified by normal users (e.g. Solana, EOS etc). Fullnodes for Ethereum and Bitcoin can be run on an $80 Raspberry Pi, meaning the average user is able to use them in a truly trustless and decentralized way.

Layer 2s are a way to make more efficient use of the limited blockspace by bundling up transactions, you can think of it a bit like compressing files into .zip or .rar folders, you can fit a lot more into a limited storage space than if you just saved the files as they are.

&gt; Layer 2 was supposed to come in the summer of 2021.

Arbitrum and Optimism both released over the summer, StarkEx and zkSync have been available much longer than that.

&gt; ""If you want low fees in ETH, just use L2!"" - What does this actually mean?

The price of a token swap (using Uniswap or one of it's forks/clones) on mainnet/Layer 1 is currently $44.45. If you were to do the same thing on Optimism or Arbitrum it would cost $3.81 or $4.68 respectively [https://l2fees.info/].

You can get to Arbitrum directly from some exchanges such as Binance or Crypto.com. You would buy your ether there and then withdraw directly to Arbitrum. Once there you can use DeFi dApps like Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap etc as you would on Layer 1. gas fees are still paid in ether, but are just much lower. Your wallet address remains the same and you can still use MetaMask as you would on L1, in fact the user experience is pretty much identical, well it's also faster than mainnet so I guess that's another plus!

&gt; Does Ethereum have an official Layer 2

No, Ethereum is a project (and a community) that values decentralization above pretty much everything else. As such there is not and will never be an official L2. Multiple teams have built different rollups and you can try whichever you like. Broadly there are 2 categories, general purpose Optimistic rollups, which allow loads of dApps to run on them, just like Ethereum mainnet and app specific ZK rollups, which are better tech but don't currently allow the same interoperability of dApps. Arbitrum and Optimism are the most well known Optimistic Rollups, with a couple more, Boba and Metis, being forks of Optimism. ZK rollups include Starknet which runs the perpetuals exchange dYdX and the NFT platform ImmutableX; zkSync which is a payments channel and has been adopted by Gitcoin Grants (among other things); and LoopRing, which is another payments platform that has risen to fame recently due to speculation about a partnership with Gamestop.

As for which one is most appropriate for you? What do you want to do? If you want to play in DeFi then Arbitrum has the most options available at the moment, as well as the advantage of being easy to get to from an exchange. If all you want to do is send a bunch of payments of ether around then probably zkSync is a better choice because each simple ether transaction will cost you less than $0.50. 

The fees on L1 are unlikely to ever go down, rollups have been the plan for scaling Ethereum for a long time, if you're interested you can read some of the discussion from October 2020 about this at: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698/4. Rollups will also be able to offer better transaction volume (and therefore fees) than any competing L1, no matter how much they sacrifice decentralization for scalability. For an overview of why this is the case you can take a look at https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/ultra-scalable-ethereum, or for a more in depth examination of why rollups will out compete everything else you can dive into Polynya's writings at https://polynya.medium.com/rollups-data-availability-layers-modular-blockchains-introductory-meta-post-5a1e7a60119d.

If you've got any questions please do post them here and I'll do my best to reply. I use Arbitrum and Optimism a lot and I'm really keen to help the rest of the community catch up!",1638043181,hmb8208

If NFT/blockchain technology is used for virtual tickets, diplomas, software licenses, etc… it could move the negative perception of NFT’s from being used for “money laundering/rich people scamming/shitty pixel art” to people understanding the true potential of this blockchain technology. 

Call this anecdotal hopium, but when a middle aged guest speaker in a business class I attend (who is a non-profit executive) brought up the blockchain and NFT’s briefly at the end of his talk, it kind of opened my eyes to how “on the radar” all of this is, even for smaller entities.

"Ok Op, I made this topic maybe you can answer my question?  


Hi  
  
As my journey into Crypto get's deeper and deeper (Never thought I'd actually get this far but I'm hooked on the tech and want to keep experimenting), I have a serious question.  
  
My broker let's me deposit Polygon (Matic) LRC and a bunch of other ERC20 tokens from my hardware wallet to their exchange where I can trade it for Fiat or other Crypto.  
  
However I'm trying to get around the high Gas Fees on the Ethereum Network. So I was thinking I'd connect my hardware wallet to Metamask and from there activate everything on the Layer 2 network (through Loopring for example).  
  
However when I go to the deposit screen of said broker, it tells me I can only deposit through the Ethereum network. It says ""\*U can only deposit this currency through the Ethereum-Network (as ERC-20 Tokens). Deposits through other networks (for example binance smart-chain network) is not supported. Use of another network than the Ethereum-Network will lead to the fact that the deposit will be completely lost""\*So does this mean I can't use Layer 2 to make a deposit to that said broker?  
  
Thank you so much in advance.  
  
TLDR; I want to deposit a bunch of ERC20 tokens to my broker to trade, I want to avoid high gas fees, through Layer2. Not sure if my broker supports it. Or is Layer2 the same as the Ethereum Network.",1638386294,hmtyy4j

I’m not going to diss you, because I appreciate reasonable discussion on this sub, but you have to look into the tech more and see what they are actually doing that taking bits of information to fit a narrative. 

Ethereum - Polygon - zkSync - Loopring 

All of these go hand in hand to help scale Ethereum to lower gas fees and to maintain decentralization. This is why you see L1s like AVAX and SOL with lower gas fees because they sacrifice decentralization in favor of lower fees, but also the current fees on those L1s are higher than what Ethereum’s was at their same volume level 

Case in point, Ethereum is leagues ahead in terms of gas fees vs other L1s when you take volume levels into consideration, AND Ethereum has maintained its decentralization",1638377189,hmtbhyq

Arbitrum, Optimism, Boba, Polygon (kinda), Hermez, Immutable, dydx, loopring etc.. laters are app specific zkr rollup ok. But zksync and starket are coming right around the corner (starknet already on mainnet in alpha).",1638324940,hmqst5i

"I like all the ""Loopring fixes this"" comments, while OP is using IMX (a Loopring competitor which has already ""fixed"" the same problem).

Eth hit a point where the network is running at max capacity ALL THE TIME around October 2021. Eth will only continue to be used more in the future, which means more people bidding up the price of eth gas fees.

Only 4.9% of Eth txs are on L2 solutions right now. Eth needs to drive users to L2 solutions FASTER than new users are using L1 solutions. That's not happening right now and that tipping point is probably pretty far away.

Eth gas is going to be a total shit show in 2022. There is no upper limit to eth gas fees, it's just users out competing each other by bidding for high gas fees. It doesn't take a lot of new txs beyond max capacity of the eth network to continue ballooning the gas fees. Make Eth 5% more popular and gas fees go up x2 or x3. People will be doing txns at 200 or 300 gwei because ""gas is so low"".",1638312450,hmq0p5j

"Wow. So I'was just going through this exact thought process when I ran across your post.   I invested in crypto in 2017 when bitcoin was hovering around the 7k mark.   I thew a bunch of cash in and watched it bounce around between 10 and 20k, I added a little bit here and there and also played a bit of the alt-coin market.  But when it started to take off and hit 30K just stopped investing.  It just felt like I was working against myself with respect to dollar cost averaging.    I've taken a bit more of an active roll this year putting some more money in an attempt to increase the value of my portfolio. It's taken a lot for me to hammer into my brain that we're only in the first inning of a 9 inning game here.  The thing that really opened my eyes was looking at the relative value of my net worth compared to the overall global fiat market cap, and then doing the same thing with my crypto holdings compared to the overall market cap of the crypto market.

"I mean polygon is actually a poor man's loopring - vitalik literally said years ago 

Optimistic rollups are easier so they will be done first 

But zkrollups are harder and will win in the end 

And loopring was the long play.

It's the poor man's polygon for market cap I guess but it's already almost 2/3 the exact same cost per token as polygons.

But the time it hits polygons mcap it will be 11$ a loop.

Also loopring didn't invest a billion dollars into optimistic rollups - but polygon did.

Loopring is true layer 2 

Polygon is a side chain

Let's be real - these apes sat on the sideline buying the same stock for a year and never ever selling.

Isn't that the literal best thing you could hope for in a holder ?

And you can't clown on loopring like memecoins because it's literally got vitaliks blessing.

Look - you don't have to buy any but even if it breaks top 50 it's a 5$ loop.

It's market cap was low as hell and still is compared to similar projects.

It's honestly a good crossroads 


Axie - rank 25ish 

Mana - rank 50ish

Enjin - rank 70ish 

Shib - rank 12ish 

Dog-e rank 10ish 

Polygon- rank 18ish 


If it captures the gaming crowd - the meme crowd and the layer 2 crowd it will definitely break the top 50.

It's not if - it's when. 

You can circlejerk ""poor man's poly"" except the entry cost will be much higher by the time it's at polygons mcap.

It might not reach absurd heights but it will definitely be great  returns medium term - any trader with eyes can see that.",1636146651,hjgu2wv

Loopring is a zkrollup which has been touted as the future of layer 2 technology by vitalik buterin himself.

They have a rumoured partnership(all but confirmed) with GameStop to produce a gaming nft exchange for them.

Crypto investors are flocking to it 

It has superior tech and fundamentals , polygon just invested a billion to chase ZKrollups technology instead of their optimistic rollups .


And best of all it has memecoin horde slowly moving towards it in the form of GME apes who are probably the most fanatic investors you could ask for in a project.

They just spent a year buying the same stock over and over without selling and there are millions of them lmao.

Loopring subreddit tripled in size in 4 days and is on a 200+ person per hour growth rate.

And loopring is still only barely in the top 100 of cryptos 

If it makes it to top 50 it will be 5$ a loop.

If it reaches polygons mcap it would be 11$ a loop 

It has the perfect storm to blow up.

The L1 provides the security and backbone of the L2. The current TPS for example on Loopring is ~4,000 TPS according to their developers on twitter.

How is this a bad thing? You need to buy ETH to do anything on Ethereum. Now the cheapest transaction costs US$4. But that's for a very basic transaction. More complicated transaction like DEX and DeFi cost a lot more. So much more that casual users are priced out. Matic is low cost but there is no guarantee that it will stay that way. Over the past couple of months the price of Matic has doubled but volume hasn't decreased making all transactions twice as costly or more. Gas on most blockchains is the price to do business. When prices aren't stable or are inflated it makes it difficult to do business with all but the privileged that can afford it. I don't know what type of system Loopring uses but the auction style systems used by ETH and Matic and others all eventually result in the same thing. Only those that can afford to bid the highest get to use the blockchain. Imagine what happens when companies and organizations that pool other people's money together decide to use all of that purchasing power on the blockchain. Then individuals will have no chance to use the blockchain without going though those companies or have to live with a blockchain where their transaction take too long and cost too much to be useful.,1639153242,ho037mv

While they’re there perfecting the tech, others have made headlines by either buying out competitors or simply making its own chain, even though they may not have gained much from initial announcement. In fact, I’m kind of worried that lrc and all L2 solutions are too early—i dont think there’s a use case for crypto yet by the general public aside from store of value, and even then that doesn’t need anything beyond btc/eth. But that’s just me.",1639150649,hnzwv9u
"\&gt; Eventually each transaction will go through

Wouldn't that be nice? No failed transactions!

Transaction fees are intended to pay for the compute power needed but that's not why they're so high. When the Eth network reaches it's capacity, then transaction fees increase and the highest paying transactions go through. If the network remains congested, lower paying transactions can eventually fail (and are still charged a transaction fee).

The consistently high gas fees we've been seeing the last couple months are from Eth runnning at near capacity 24/7. It used to be that you could lowball a transaction fee and when Eth network usage dipped at night time, it'd be processed. Now there are always a huge stack of relatively high-bid transactions queued up waiting to be processed throughout the night.

Also, I haven't used Loopring yet, but their fees are 1.5% of the transacted value? Anyone know otherwise? l2fees.info shows the current cost of a transaction for Eth at $5 and Loopring at $0.20.

Anyhow, Loopring fees are a function of the base Eth fees. So if the Eth network gets congested consistently, then those fees go up. $0.20 isn't bad (but hardly great). If Eth gets any more popular though, those L2 fees will go up ... at least until some Eth scaling solutions land.

All L2 solutions are less than 5% of all Eth transactions right now. That number is increasing but so is the overall number of L1 transactions. We might find out in 2022 just how high gas fees can reach before Eth adoption is halted. Maybe the first sharding implementation will go live near the end of 2022, but there's a pretty good chance sharding is going to be a 2023/24 thing.",1639150191,hnzvs4k

"this is not entirely correct I'm afraid

partners of Looprings solution obviously must 'hold' a certain number of LRC for backing up their own application: that partner will in that sense have their own 'internal market' 

Let's say Gamestop ends up what is expected: partnering with Loopring to hold account for  transactions on the Ethereum blockchain through Looprings L2 solution.

In this example gamers will f.i. trade or buy items in-game, and instead of using fiat (which they obviously invested some in LRC for this Gamestop application) their settlements are done with LRC tokens

Gamestop next to that might reward their Power-Up participants with (fractional) LRC tokens, so it'll need LRC tokens

and so on

the Loopring zkRollup L2 solution would mean, when adoption becomes substantial, it would besides taking congestion of the ETH blockchain for less advanced (i.e. retail buying or selling a crypto, an nft, a game or an in-game feature  f.i.)  transactions as its dApp combines thousands of those simple transactions and offer  those as 1 transaction to ETH, whilst backing its dApp with ETH security so basically opening up the Ethereum blockchain to everybody.

And I learned that Looprings solution is being developed to handle way more TPS than 2000/s, basically free from charge, and that would open up mass use of their zkRollup

"This is exactly why I think Ethereum is in a great frontier position right now. The L1 blockchain allows for a lot of the functionality to work on a core level, but the L2 solutions being presented are excellent: you have Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Immutable X, Loopring, and Skale (a personal favorite after reading the whitepaper) all looking to split the difficulty of user traffic into separate solutions.

Again, though, right now it's quite difficult to move money around given the gas fees. You have to be very deliberate with what you're doing, which is fine by me.

Parity Technologies and Tendermint both offer solutions in this same regard but it's not exactly the same. I think the Substrate (Polkadot, Kusama) ecosystem is a bit closer to what Ethereum is doing right now.

Starport (Cosmos) allows people to leverage boilerplate code for independent blockchains, and it actually has a good rep on this subreddit, but it's ironic since all of the big chains that were developed on it are pretty monolithic in nature: CRO and BSC are two big ones, and I'm even a bit skeptical of Terra's (LUNA) blockchain being fully decentralized since the token is staked in order to provide collateral and, whaddya know, *also provides governance rights*. The price is likely to increase, but only 4% of the LUNA tokens were allocated to genesis liquidity:

&gt;LUNA was first made available for purchase in a private token sale for initial investors, which included the investment arms of major exchanges such as Binance, OKEx and Huobi. The sale concluded in August 2018, and as a result, Terra raised $32 million. Of the 385,245,974 LUNA minted for the sale, 10% was reserved for Terraform Labs, 20% for employees and project contributors, 20% for the Terra Alliance, 20% for price stability reserves, 26% for project backers and 4% for genesis liquidity.

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/)

Decentralization is a very, very abstract concept, imo, and personally Ethereum is probably the closest thing to it, though I do worry as it shifts to Serenity (due to the PoS 32 ETH threshold). Time will tell.",1639119662,hnykf88

They think they're playing a zero-sum game and pushing the attention away from SOL to their own coin, but all they're doing is convincing some guy with a couple hundred bucks (that could use a few more) to buy into a pump and dump and lose their money.

"This is a really good read, a little excerpt:

“ZK-Rollups are an innovation initially launched on Ethereum that enables layer 2 transactions to be transmitted and verified by the Ethereum network without the Ethereum nodes knowing the details of each transaction. It is designed to offer greater scalability to the Ethereum network by only requiring the Ethereum nodes to verify the proof of computation rather than the transaction data itself.

"Kinda apples and oranges... both of these are non-custodial wallets (your keys your coins) but structured very differently.

Nano x is an ""offline"" device that stores the cryptographic key associated with an externally owned account (EOA).  That key has to be used to sign a transaction before the transaction can be transferred to the network and processed.

With a hardware wallet... you sign the transaction from the offline device, so your key that is used to sign is never on an online device, it is impossible to extract a private key from a signed message so a hardware wallet is the highest level of security.  A hardware wallet is the opposite of a hot wallet (like your phone) where the key is stored on a device that is online so could potentially get hacked.

Loopring wallet I don't have any experience with specifically... but I know it is a smart contract wallet which provides some interesting possibilities.  With a smart contract wallet you create a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain.  That contract had a private key that owns it, and can have several other keys with specific privilege levels.  This opens up possibilities like.... assign an owner key, assign 5 guardian keys, set transaction limits (contract can send 1 eth per day maximum unless transaction signed by 3/5 guardian keys).  4/5 guardian keys can transfer contract ownership to new key (if your key gets compromised... contract limits the amount you lose to 1 eth and then you are able to transfer ownership to new key and kick old key out of the wallet).

"&gt;there is no evidence of this rumor

There is absolutely evidence. The fact that you state that just tells me that you haven't bothered to read into anything.

&gt;The GME thing is obviously the only reason anyone is holding that coin

Except it's not. I didn't buy into LRC because GME had anything to do with it, in fact it was Buterin's conversation on the future of ZK rollups and his mention of Loopring as being a very interesting option. Many people here will tell you a very similar story of how they came to look at LRC as a promising coin.

The fact that the GME apes came in and pumped it was just icing on the cake for someone who bought it at .50ish",1639429394,hofddh0

People can get into crypto using cheap centralized exchanges and then maybe move to real crypto where it can get expensive or more complex. Or they can start right with the real thing using wallets, smartcontracts, etc. but it as we all know this can be a complex to those just starting.

Looping will be a third way of getting into crypto: A descentralized exchange where people can start cheap and own the coins with the possibility of interacting with normal eth contracts. First timers can simply use fiat on ramp service to fund the layer 2 wallet, do trading just like at binance with low fees, but they will own the coins, later own when you are sure you want to interact with something else the layer 1 activation and fees are needed (just like when withdrawing from CEX to wallet to wherever)",1639425798,hof4r2z

If you haven't seen the posts from the guy who buys $1000 every January of the top 10, I  think they're worth considering.

"In our rules we have strict standards about vote manipulation and brigading. This is because people do make financial decisions based off information on this subreddit, and therefore it’s not right to present an artificial perspective on a project based on how many people can be corralled into shouting it from the rooftops.  

Reddit also has strict guidance on brigading which by their definition is sharing links from outside sources and encouraging people to come in and vote your POV up and everyone else who may oppose it down. 

So bearing those two things in mind, Loopring got very popular very quickly which absolutely isn’t a problem. What became a problem was when we received multiple reports of link sharing and people saying “go to the cryptocurrency subreddit and upvote everything LRC you see”.  

We asked the moderators of reddit and discord to implement checks to ensure links to our sub are filtered, but they initially didn’t. All the while our sub was filling up with people that have never ever posted here before singling LRC’s praises. So it was put on a blacklist for like a day.  

In that time the mods of Loopring socials implemented some basic filters which stopped the bulk of it, so it was removed from blacklist.  

People were banned because we specifically said “don’t try and game the automoderator” and people started calling it “poop thing” and using emojis. That’s a case of play stupid games win stupid prizes.  

We don’t normally add projects to a blacklist unless brigading is really bad. Safemoon is one such crypto that remains on blacklist. While we’ve seen a couple threads linked within LRC socials in the meantime, these are quickly removed. But LRC was placed on blacklist because there were multiple concurrent threads, comments absolutely everywhere and it was impossible to tell who was a real account and who had been corralled to post in the sub.

Growth but not a lot.

It's hard to do a x10 if your market cap is already 1 trillion.

A respectable x2-x3 depending on how well the economy holds with all the problems (tether, evergrande, china ban, binance being blocked in more countries, still no Eth solving their gas fees)

**Loss**

Which is what I think.

Terrible problems in the crypto economy. Mostly due to the world problems. Unstable economy, pandemic, evergrande, china ban, binance, tether, money printer goes brrrr.

Probably at the start of the bear market. Maybe we get one good green candlestick around christmas early january because people pump in their christmas and new year's bonuses and then ride that for a short time until whales play their game again and cash out all the longs and shorts.

Some alt coins will do very well simply because they are necessary or just normal development if you look at the past (looking specifically at 3 coins: loopring, matic solutions to the eth gas fees and cryptodotcom because every cex has a succesful coin, and cryptodotcom is advertising like crazy.

"So what's the beef with ""loopers""? 

Shilling generally means pushing info (most of the time lies) to people that haven't heard about it and don't really have a want to hear about it right? 

Maybe I am misunderstanding that first of all. 

But are there just certain crypto we can't talk about on this sub? 

I know tether is literally just a worse version than the fed, and there are some dumb things there in the top ten. 

But at the end I saw something about ""loopers being shills"" and I have not seen ONE SINGLE thing on thus subreddit explaining loopring to me. Just slander. 

I used programmerhumor and other subs to slowly learn to code so I wanted to use this sub for crypto and a few others, but what is this upmost bais against certain crypto? 

Polygon is doing what loopring is doing right? So what are the differences and why can't we discuss them on a crypto sub? Maybe I'd rather the loopring over my matic idk. And because you guys won't allow me to learn about the differences it feels",1640364739,hptozwb

Argent wallet, a ZkSync wallet the L2 is free, but have to pay gas to activate the L1 wallet. Didn't fund it, because I don't know much about ZkSync. Really nothing much to see here on the Argent. Boring.

Totally agree that a vast majority of people here have no idea how investing works. I’ve pressed some mega bulls before on why they are so huge on their token/coin and the responses are… troubling. 

Example: someone made a post about why LRC is going to moon with the upcoming GameStop/Loopring announcement.

"Jsyk staking and liquidity providing (LP) in an AMM are different things. Staking is done to lock up some coins as a form of security, and new coins are minted for your rewards. LP is done anywhere you can swap tokens and you're collecting trading fees from people using your coins.

&gt;Do I get the same amount of coins back if they appreciated while they were staking? Are there any other risks?

Not if you're using an AMM, and there are some risks. It's called [impermanent loss](https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/). Essentially when you LP you're trading between the two coins, when the value of one drops and the other increases you trade until your bags have equal value. That means if both your coins were worth 100 when you started, and now one is worth 50 and the other is 200 you've 'lost' money compared to if you just held both coins. It's called impermanent because you haven't lost anything until you close the position, it could come back.


If you expect a coin to take off soon then it's not good to LP in it, since you'll definitely get hit with impermanent loss. I'm expecting LRC to jump 50% in the next weeks so I'm avoiding those pairs right now. It's best to LP in pairs whose charts look the same so you end up with an equal amount of crypto by the end plus the fees you've earned.


&gt;And what exchanges do you guys use to stake and what is the safest/ trustworthy

I use the Loopring dex exclusively right now. It's its own layer-2 on Ethereum so there are no gas fees. It's an extra step to onboard (you need to use cash, or pay L1 gas fees to move crypto in). I used Uniswap to LP before and it was $100+ gas per click and so very stressful to learn or make a profit. 


&gt;Is there any big mistakes i should watch out for also to not lose my tokens accidentally?

Don't LP in *shitcoins*, or tokens with very low volume. If you're in an ASS/ETH pair and the ASS token gets rug pulled or crashes there won't be anyone left for you to sell your coins to. You won't run into this unless you're chasing 1,000%+ apr.

&gt;What are the best coins for staking? And what happens if the exchange gets hacked

You can stake *any* POS coins on your own by running a node/miner but it's usually a huge investment, and you'll have your stake slashed if you do anything wrong. The alternative is giving coins to an exchange to to do it for you for some % of the reward, or giving your coins to an exchange to lend out as loans. Unless you're technical and have 32ETH laying around I'd use a exchange to stake for now until better options emerge. I only trust Coinbase and Kraken to custody my coins. 

If an exchange gets hacked while you're staking you're SOL though. There are some coins, I think Algo, that let you stake any amount in a wallet that you custody, but it's not common. 

If you end up with LP tokens and the AMM site disappears there's always a way to interact with the contact itself on the blockchain, instead of through the site, to unlock your tokens. It's a very [manual](https://medium.com/acryptos/removeliquidity-the-hard-way-937f7b67818b) procedure but still great to have the option in the first place.



&gt;Is there any places to go to learn more about staking thats noob friendly would also be appreciated

This is a nice writeup.

https://beincrypto.com/learn/yield-farming-vs-staking/

There aren't many hubs of good information, I find it's all scattered around. If you ask though usually someone answers, or if you search something and add 'Reddit' at the end someone may have asked here before.


&gt;Also are there any projects that have created new or better staking utilisation/protocol?

Any AMM that supports a layer 2. :) Or else you have to LP $5000+ to cover enough gas to make $1.

If you're simply looking for rewards for holding a coin you can throw it all into your favourite CEX that supports soft staking (can withdraw at any time) and use it as a savings account. I always prefer to custody my coins so I'll pay any gas fees, but that depends on you.",1640617944,hq5j8w2

Yahoo! was more developed in many arenas but Google had a solid foundation in a superior tech. Google devoured its competitors and began to diversify, becoming the company it is today.

"Bro, relax, right now we dont need a ""next big thing"" we need some more adoption. We need some of the promising projects to succeed outside of our Crypto bubble.

Try not to chase all those fancy screenshots with million % of gains because

1. you never know how much is real
2. you only get those great gain with even greater risk

So yeah, making 1000$ from 100 is cool and all but many times it wont go that way and you have to live with the fact that your 100$ can go to 0.

If you want some solid advice, something you can do with a big chunk of your money, go and invest in some more reliable projects. As i said, Ether is in a very good position right now. Many Exchanges have their own coin and offer great staking rewards. CRO from [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) for example. Or invest in the Luna Eco system.

But nobody hear can tell you with a certainty this or that project is going to moon. 

As for Loopring, it could have easily gone down as well. I just felt comfortable taking that risk and not minding loosing my 100$ if it doesnt go well.",1637084971,hkvnsd3

The latest for me was Loopring. Got some 300% from it, but i didnt take profits right now. There was a top at which i could have exited at 450% but didnt, because in my opinion it can rise some more. Be wary though, Loopring is a bit of a mix between good project and meme till its - POSSIBLY - linked with gamestop. Its value right now is based of rumors.

"This is a patent for digital currency transactions. We all know China will have its own digital Yuan. This isn't what I was talking about. 

I'm sure you've heard that El Salvador is using Algorand for it's Government infrastructure, and these are the type of real world use cases I'm speaking of. Not some method to transfer digital Yuan to a meta verse currency. This is sounds like an on ramp from Fiat to Loopring that's just a patent. 

If China were to use Ethereum or Loopring for their digital Yuan then I would change my mind. For all we know the bank is just doing research on Blockchains.

"I know that the following coin shouldn‘t be mentioned on this sub but I really want to understand the difference between Polygon and Loopring. I have read that LRC is also going for a zK-Rollup and zkEVM. 

Is there a major difference between the zK-Rollups between these two? (I‘m not that savvy with the blockchain technology and I‘m sure someone know more than me and can answer my question)",1637080192,hkvbjn1
"This is a problem that ZK rollups (of which Loopring is one) attempt to solve.

Essentially, think of a rollup as a highly optimised database of sorts, that contains all the indexed accounts (no addresses, an account has a fixed index, and your address is mapped to that account outside of the database), contract code, etc that exists within the rollup, that is then stored on he Ethereum chain in a smart contract. Transactions are submitted to an external entity that executes transactions off chain, then generates bundles that are posted on chain that remove much of the unnecessary data, essentially leaving just the changes that need to be made to the database.

Because everything stored within the rollup is stored on chain in a smart contract, it's essentially impossible for the data storage portion of the rollup to be compromised or disappear. The execution portion of the rollup may be compromised, meaning you can't transact within the rollup, but, provided the smart contract(s) are written to, you're perfectly able to interact with the rollup's data directly from Ethereum, including directly withdrawing your funds.

Loopring's smart contracts allow you to do so, [it's not an easy process, there's a lot of technical steps that have to be taken to directly withdraw your assets from Ethereum](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/withdraw-from-loopring-3-1-the-first-ever-experiment-of-shutting-down-a-zkrollup-24e6f333ca57), and it can get quite expensive, but it *is* possible to do so, without Loopring having to be functional at all. Provided Ethereum itself is functional, and the smart contracts don't have any bugs or aren't written maliciously, you do withdraw any time you want, without having to go through the ZK rollup itself.",1637077705,hkv5cwj

"You can't do shit on Loopring lmao, all you can do is swap between tokens. That's beyond useless if you ask me. Who will pay to bridge tokens onto a layer 2 to only swap between tokens to then bridge out of it?

yes polygon is extremely centralised, and it's a side-chain, not actually a rollup.

Optimism currently is centralised, yes, but at some point it wont be. Since it's EVM compatible, every working dapp on the main net will be ported to its layer 2, so at some point you will be able to do everything on optimism without ever leaving it unless you want to withdraw to fiat (but at some point coinbase/okex and more exchanges will have l2 fiat on and off ramps).

Currently, no chain offers fast/scalable/decentralised transactions/smart contracts capabilities. But Eth 2.0 with its network of fully developped rollups will.

If you don't care about centralisation, then indeed rollups won't bring you anything useful. I mean, what's even the point of crypto to you other than making money if you don't care about centralisation?",1637075089,hkuz3vb

"Vitalik talked openly about the Layer 2s and zkRollups that would be able to fix the gas fees on Ethereum, and he very recently commented on a post on Reddit  right here: 

""Loopring is also one of the very few with proper transaction data compression (~16 bytes on chain per tx), though I think especially once we go ZK they will all move in that direction"" - it's on the Ethereum subreddit. 

Ethereum is growing bigger and bigger, so in my opinion, these l2 zks projects will have a massive lead along with Eth, and the fact that Vitalik is just saying those things makes it even better to have Loopring at this point, and let's not forget that they are launching soon a layer 2 wallet and all the GME NFT thing, which could be one of the biggest online platforms for gaming+nfts and both of these trends are getting more and more popular as you may be aware.

I can say with this, LRC can easily compete in the top 15 or even 10, in a few years where the crypto industry as grown and started to be more utilized, and people will realize it in these upcoming weeks. As long as crypto grows, and Ethereum becomes more upgraded and popular, so will the majority of layer 2 and zkrs and I think Loopring is right now one of the best if not the best use case for it (Vitalik approved which for me is a great sign!).

That's why I'm talking about the circulating supply, it was 96% last week and recently moved to 97%. This is massive for what may be about to happen, a coin/project thats going to have a huge presence soon is only at a 3% availability, making it already scarce, thus reaching 100% in a few time and entering the supply demand situation, which will gradually grow the coins price over time.

To answer your question of market cap, I would say the following, right now ETH/LRC ratio is about 100/1, making it Ethereum 100 times bigger than LRC, and I can easily see it coming to about 50x only. If the crypto market cap reaches the ambitious 10 trillion like many would suggest with mass adoption and everything in a few years which I think it's very likely to happen, Ethereum would probably continue with his aprox 19% market domination, putting it at about 2 trillion market cap, so this would mean Loopring along some layer 2s would have at about 50x less than that (aprox) making it around 40 billion which is almost the same as Polkadot right now, which isn't even that bad!

I'm just speculating on a normal theory of how the market could grow and obviously nobody knows shit about the future, one day every country could start banning it and tracing people of use it (hopefully not and don't think that can happen rn with the quantity of the market cap) but I can be as realistic as a 15 billion market cap minimum for Loopring and some other layer 2 sure, in a year time span if they start to get recognized, so imagine this scenario right now on a 97% asset circulation.. yeah.

"It really depends how you define ‘facilitate’.

With decentralized exchanges, the ones facilitating are the liquidity providers. The exchange itself is just a fancy graphical interface for code deployed on a blockchain. For example to use uniswap you could skip the homepage and just open up the contract on etherscan and write to it manually. Uniswap the company could get sued to oblivion and forced to shut down all of their websites, and yet Uniswap the exchange would still be online and usable. Which is sort of the point.

This means technically anyone LP’ing is supposed to KYC their customers. The whole point of a decentralized exchange is that it’s trustless and permissionless. Any address can interact with the contract. So this is obviously impossible. So most people are just ignoring it. But it’s still lazy and bad regulation.

This extends to things like LRC. LRC holders earn a portion of trading fees. So if a terrorist uses Loopring to swap their ETH to SHIB, you get fees and terrorists are essentially paying you to swap their money. Is that facilitating? Up to the courts.

There’s a lot of people now who most likely won’t be prosecuted but could technically be considered to be breaking US law. This is why people are upset",1637046295,hktrmng

*Rumored* partnership. All signs point to GME setting up their NFT Marketplace with Loopring - this is the hype, and how GME factors in. This is a typical ""buy the news"" scenario, except, there is a fundamentally sound project behind it this time.

No, not magic. You can just use a centralized exchange onramp if you want no gas fees to save a little on that one-time transaction, or if you don't care you can just swap from an existing wallet. There's a few CEX onramps already and many more on the way of course.

"1. The high fees are a result of how successful Ethereum is. People still transact on it regardless of how expensive it is, because it's the most secure and decentralised smart contract chain that has been battle tested time and time again. The little guys may be pushed out of the network (at least out of the L1 chain, onto L2s where transaction fees are a fraction of a fraction of what they cost on the L1 chain), but the big guys will always want to transact on it, because of how secure and reliable it is.

2. There's already solutions in the works, some available right now. L2s are already available and can reduce fees by several times (up to 20x or more in the case of ZK rollups like Loopring), while still being secured by the L1 chain. L2s are being continually worked on to make them faster, cheaper and more secure, with ZK rollups being the best solution we have right now, literally inheriting all of the upsides of the L1 chain (decentralisation and security), while offering fast and cheap transactions. On top of that, data sharding is planned to be rolled out sometime after the switch to PoS, which will improve L2s (specifically rollups) *even further.*

In short, L2s are where you want to be from now on, as the L1 chain is designed to be as decentralised and secure as possible, to make it a stable and reliable foundation for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. L2s rely on that decentralisation and security of the L1 chain to deliver the high scalability with low fees that we so desparately want.",1635780717,hiw6nv0

Understanding the hype behind Loopring.

Facts: 


1. Listed as a coin to watch on Grayscale (Canadian retirement fund with $40bn AUM) the previous coin to get accepted 2x'd in the same month. Source: Founder on twitter posting screenshot of document from Grayscale



2. Fee-less wallet will launch this week on the L2. So setting up a wallet which currently costs 150usd will become 0. Source: their Dev's on discord. Update: New changes on GitHub reflect this already! 



3. Staking is also be available via their official wallet 



4. Bank of China Patent includes use of LRC as you may be aware of it. 



5. Q4 2021 announcement nearing everyday 



6. GitHub code shows GameStop services mentioned twice. One time regarding export of NFT and later on in the second leak showed their beta testing url (staging server) whose SSL certificate ownership lies with GameStop.


7. 10% burn on transaction fees 



8. Exchanges if they want to use loopring need to hold 250k LRC on-chain or 1m LRC off-chain - which means every new exchange on this will reduce the supply of coins on the market.


9. The new wallet supports Fiat ramp-on and Fiat ramp-off. Update: To be launched in Q3 2022 as per official discord


10. Being Layer 2 and having ZK-Rollup allows it to process 4000 transactions per second. Once Eth 2.0 goes live, this will scale up as well. 

11. Loopring is also an AMM 

Opinion:



1. GME announcement about their NFT market place will be a huge doubling event for the coin 



2. Relatively low market cap and wide wallet acceptance will sky rocket the price


3. Personally, I feel we are looking at a $10 coin in the next 2-3 months by January. 


4. D. Wang said that the announcement will be worth 10 Quarterly reports 

Price per coin against Marker Cap - Source: Coin Perspective:

1. If Loopring enters the top 10 and gets to the 34.7bn Market Cap that's required for it, it's price per coin would be $27.84

2. If Loopring overtakes Doge's market cap of 36.3bn at number 9, it's price per coin would be $29.13

3. If Loooring overtakes DOT's market cap of 53.4bn at number 8, it's price per coin would be $42.84

4. At top 20, if Loopring overtakes MATIC's market cap of 12.6bn, it's price per coin would be $10.08",1637427624,hlejaf0

"If you are holding a coin and you plan to keep it, staking is one of the best helps out there, you simply win free money just holding your coin...

Obviously having 100$ to start with isn't much and you won't see a difference, but if you been accumulating a certain coin with high % then you will see differences.

I will give you the best example I don't see a lot of people mentioning and I'm abusing of it right now: AXS on Binance with a 110% for 30 days. 

You won't be gaining 110% on those 30 days obviously, but rather about 9% of what you totally invested, and this is massive for people like me at least. I managed to accumulate to about 60 AXS as of today and I'm getting about 5.4 AXS every month, which is literally about the same amount of money I'm doing on my work! 

The more time and time I spend on accumulating the gained AXS and paychecks into more staked AXS, the more I will be winning, and one day probably more than my job pays lol... obviously this has several cons like AXS price beeing dependent to it and probably one day the coin's staking will end on Binance, but till then I'm just getting money like a second job, for free basically.

Now you tell me if those low % are worthed, I mean maybe? Again if you in for holding that coin, I don't see why. I'm legit waiting for a Loopring staking on Binance which I don't think will happen anytime soon because I know I will be holding it for at least a year or two, same goes for Ethereum which I staked for the 2.0 thing.",1637426791,hleh8sm

"Polygon is great but it is not a layer 2. It is a side chain. By definition, layer 2s inherit full security from layer 1. Examples of this are Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, zkSwap, zkSync, dYdX, Hermez.

Polygon's main chain (the one with 99% of their TVL) is a side chain, because it relies on its own (much weaker) security. If the Polygon network is 34% attacked, it will fall, and there is nothing that Ethereum can do about it. On the other hand, for a layer 2 like Arbitrum to fail, Ethereum itself (with its drastically larger validator pool) would need to be 51% attacked.

Polygon is great, but it isn't solving the blockchain trilemma. It is absolutely dominating in the scaling category, but it pays for that by being much weaker in the security and decentralization categories.

The reason most people believe that true L2s and not sidechains are the future of scaling solutions is because ultimately we don't want to sacrifice security and decentralization. So projects like rollup L2s are trying to preserve security and decentralization while offering scaling, which means the amount of scaling (ie: cheapness of fees) they can offer isn't as great as Polygon's.

All this being said, Polygon has rollups in the works, and currently has the Hermez network which uses zk rollups (but has virtually 0 TVL), but they are behind by quite a bit in this domain compared to all the current L2s that already have rollups working with billions in TVL. Until Polygon's main chain is using rollups, it will not be a true L2, and will instead be more of a bandaid solution in lieu of layer 2s.

Edit: I say all this with love for Polygon as I have had a great time yield farming in their ecosystem.",1637373486,hlc49cd

"Hi everyone. I'm a GME ape but I come in peace. I come here only to seek knowledge and grow some wrinkles. 

I have a really, really smooth question for you guys today. As someone that's thinking about getting into the crypto space for the first time (and looking at Loopring specifically), can one of you guys please tell me what it is that I'd be buying if I were to purchase an LRC? I get that Loopring runs on L2 (and why that's good, bc of lower gas fees, etc), but as a total smoothie, I'm failing to understand what each LRC coin (token?) represents. Are they essentially ""shares"" of Loopring, the company? Or are they the coins that you need to transact on the network/exchange somehow? 

I'm just very confused here. Please tell me what I'd be buying if I purchase some LRC on Coinbase all high on hopium!!!",1635598082,himy79r

OR consider LRC/Loopring that will be the protocol that Gamestops NFT marketplace is built on... set to release any day now in Q4....marketplace fees will go back to Loopring stakers (developers words) 

I wonder what the insane GME crowd/meme crowd  will do when they see LRC spammed everywhere and anywhere

Gamestop also has a massiveee retail following with insane leadership...they are going for it all.

Loopring developers said themselves in their discord yesterday that fees on the marketplace will filter back to Loopring stakers.

Can't go wrong at this marketcap... Just takes a bit of retail interest and big players to pump it easily... wonder what happens when the official announcements come out and the NDA (non disclosure agreement) drops 😉

I predict this marketplace will be as customer friendly to the masses as possible atm (speculation)

Understanding the hype behind Loopring.

Facts: 


1. Listed as a coin to watch on Grayscale (Canadian retirement fund with $40bn AUM) the previous coin to get accepted 2x'd in the same month. Source: Founder on twitter posting screenshot of document from Grayscale



2. Fee-less wallet will launch this week on the L2. So setting up a wallet which currently costs 150usd will become 0. Source: their Dev's on discord. Update: New changes on GitHub reflect this already! 



3. Staking is also be available via their official wallet 



4. Bank of China Patent includes use of LRC as you may be aware of it. 



5. Q4 2021 announcement nearing everyday 



6. GitHub code shows GameStop services mentioned twice. One time regarding export of NFT and later on in the second leak showed their beta testing url (staging server) whose SSL certificate ownership lies with GameStop.


7. 10% burn on transaction fees 



8. Exchanges if they want to use loopring need to hold 250k LRC on-chain or 1m LRC off-chain - which means every new exchange on this will reduce the supply of coins on the market.


9. The new wallet supports Fiat ramp-on and Fiat ramp-off. Update: To be launched in Q3 2022 as per official discord


10. Being Layer 2 and having ZK-Rollup allows it to process 4000 transactions per second. Once Eth 2.0 goes live, this will scale up as well. 

11. Loopring is also an AMM 

Opinion:



1. GME announcement about their NFT market place will be a huge doubling event for the coin 



2. Relatively low market cap and wide wallet acceptance will sky rocket the price


3. Personally, I feel we are looking at a $10 coin in the next 2-3 months by January. 


4. D. Wang said that the announcement will be worth 10 Quarterly reports 

Price per coin against Marker Cap - Source: Coin Perspective:

1. If Loopring enters the top 10 and gets to the 34.7bn Market Cap that's required for it, it's price per coin would be $27.84

2. If Loopring overtakes Doge's market cap of 36.3bn at number 9, it's price per coin would be $29.13

3. If Loooring overtakes DOT's market cap of 53.4bn at number 8, it's price per coin would be $42.84

4. At top 20, if Loopring overtakes MATIC's market cap of 12.6bn, it's price per coin would be $10.08",1637578167,hlmiut8

I'm not sure how long it's going to take other solutions to get up to speed, but I don't think it's a coincidence that these announcements are all happening at the precipice of LRCs hype (ie zksync with crypto.com, and Polygon's Miden). At any rate, I bet on the token that I have right now. I'm also a bit impartial to tokens that have real world use-cases for the average joe, which is why the GME announcement made me happy; it shows that those devs have that kind of initiative and I'm expecting more partnerships like it. That being said,  whenever zksyncs token comes out I'll eat that shit up too.",1637574037,hlme6jk

"I have huge holdings in both coins. All I stated was that Polygon has not moved appropriately to the market and is poised for an explosion in price and people are not inclined to purchase a coin like Loopring that has just gone up exponentially.

I'm not sure why you are so defensive, I don't care which pays off more, I want them both to succeed....Lol",1637539897,hlks0d2

"Ok, let’s see which pays off more. You moved the goalposts to Polygon being “safer”. Before you talked about Polygon’s price not exploding yet. Polygons market cap is already 3x that of Loopring. Loopring will make people more money quicker.",1637539310,hlkqpd5

"Polygon has a lot more partnerships that are actually secured. Loopring had a price explosion for a rumored (hopefully true) partnership with GameStop. If that partnership doesn't come to fruition, Loopring will drop drastically, and will take a bit to recover, luckily it's still technically sound, but it will be a short-term disaster. Loopring is still a gamble right now, while Polygon keeps making great moves. A safer bet currently is with Polygon.",1637538893,hlkpsk0

"Ethereum fees are so high because the blocks are full, only Bitcoin and Ethereum have reached this barrier and both have chosen to scale using layer 2 solutions (Lightning and Rollups respectively).

Other chains either have less transactions to deal with (e.g. Litecoin and ETC) or sacrifice decentralization by having blocks so large that they chain can't be verified by normal users (e.g. Solana, EOS etc). Fullnodes for Ethereum and Bitcoin can be run on an $80 Raspberry Pi, meaning the average user is able to use them in a truly trustless and decentralized way.

It's true that projects that target low value investors and deploy to Mainnet rather than to an L2, marketing to people who don't understand transaction fees, have caused a lot of anger, but all of this could have been avoided if the 'developers' of ~~shitcoins ponzis~~ 'projects' like ShibCum/SafeElon or whatever had just used a sidechain like xDAI or Polygon, or indeed a proper rollup like Arbitrum or Optimism.

As it is, a lot of people are using Mainnet (hence the full blocks) and it is where the vast majority of DeFi is being built, infact the Total Value Locked in DeFi on Ethereum is worth double that on every other chain combined. Similarly, the number of devs working in the Ethereum ecosystem (i.e. Mainnet / The Beacon Chain/ Rollups / Sidechains) is more than the total number of Devs working on everything else in crypto.

You talk about occasional bread crumbs such as 2.0 (by which you presumably mean The Merge), but the truth is scaling has been rolling out since August, with Optimistic rollups you can use now with most of the major dApps (Curve, UniSwap, Balancer, SushiSwap, Synthetix etc) already on at least Arbitrum or Optimism. In the next couple of weeks we're expecting to see StarkNet, roll out, which will add to the zkRollups already available and in use such as LoopRing and zkSync.

As for whether these are the solutions people are looking for, the gas fees for a swap on Optimism or Arbitrum are about 90% cheaper than on mainnet, sending tokens on zkSync or Loopring is about 95% cheaper than on mainnet... the solutions are already coming online if people care to use them.

But obviously you're not going to mention any of this next time someone brings up Ethereum's high fees, even if it would likely help them out, because you're invested in ETC and so presumably all the development going on in Ethereum makes you feel sad about your dead chain...

"DEX is definitely the solution. However today we have the challenge that we need to pay “unnecessary” fee’s to move our bags from CEX to DEX. 

I’m looking forward to Looprings roadmap, they are supposed to launch a fiat on-ramp directly to L2. Thus, killing the middle man (Coinbase, Binance). 

Traditional CEX will of course have its users. I for one think that Coinbase is a very user friendly platform and think that beginners will start there. However, as soon as they start reading and learn about crypto they’ll join the rest by transferring their fiat directly to Loopring smart wallet and make their trades on L2 directly. 

Yea I’m a LRC holder and I’m proud of it.

"Loopring has its own exchange built into the protocol. If you withdraw to a metamask wallet and connect it to the protocol you can use the exchange. It's somewhat expensive to get set up due to ETH gas fees, but much cheaper than previous rivals, I've tried using several similar platforms in the past but have hit walls when it comes to fees. This is the first one that's been within reasonable amounts for an average investor. The whole point in layer 2 solutions like loopring is to take transactions of the ETH layer 1 chain, which will reduce the transaction fees, so the best part is the more adoption that happens, the cheaper and more accessible it will become for everyone to use. If you're exchanging for fiat you'll still need to use an exchange like coinbase, but the boom is about the underlying technology called zero-knowledge (ZK) Rollups which allow near feeless transactions whilst maintaining the security of Ethereum.

I myself have a stack sat on Looprings exchange and am using it for trading. Alongside ETH2.0, layer 2 scaling solutions are the next step for Ethereum in this financial revolution, and this is one of the first implementations, accessible to all, in that direction.

"###State of the MOONion

So glad to be writing the corny title for the first time. We love it!

#1 - SUBREDDIT CHANGES  

One of the big news items for the subreddit was the temporary blacklist applied to Loopring - I'll go in to this in more detail in the Manipulation section, but I wanted to state this isn't the first project to be temporarily blacklisted for rule-breaking around vote manipulation and brigading.

As usual, the simpler questions have been directed towards the Daily Discussion threads, as well as some perspective, speculation and anecdotal posts - do you feel this has materially improved the diversity of the Daily Discussion and reduced the quantity of repetitive comments? Please let us know.

#2 - AMA's  

We try and regularly get the wider Crypto community to get involved in the subreddit and this last month saw 5 official AMA's - We've compiled them for you.  

[1. Safeseed returned on Nov 13 to do another giveaway of their metal stamping kits and some MOONs and discuss the importance of wallet seed backups](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qt0t2x/safe_seed_5oz_silver_bar_stamp_kit_molybdenum/)

[2. On Nov 16 the lead devs of Syscoin came on to talk about how Syscoin tries to leverage Bitcoin's proven security and Ethereum's Turing-complete programmability elevated to true L2 scalability via ZK-Rollups](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qv1cgq/join_the_revolution_syscoin_is_the_best_of/)

[3. The folks from OASIS protocol joined us on Nov 17 to discuss how their privacy-enabled, layer-1 blockchain network with its high throughput, low gas fees and secure architecture, is able to power scalable DeFi, revolutionizing Open Finance and expanding it beyond traders and early adopters to a mass market](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qvyw0n/we_are_oasis_the_leading_privacyenabled_layer1/)

[4. Coinsmart, an exchange that recently went public, came by on Nov 22 to talk about becoming a publicly traded company in Canada, adding new assets, and onboarding new users](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qzounr/im_justin_hartzman_ceo_of_coinsmart_a_crypto/)

[5. US Senate Candidate Morgan Harper dropped in on Nov 23 to discuss her campaign in Ohio and the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r0r0k8/ama_on_rcryptocurrency_is_live_8pm_et_im_morgan/ )

#3 - MANIPULATION  

It's not just Moons that are the objective for Manipulation, but often a desire to see a certain narrative or inflated popularity pushed. We realise that a some of you have made financial decisions based off advice in this subreddit - at least to some capacity. And therefore it's important that we try and keep discussions natural. If something is popular - then it's popular!

However, we have very strict rules around brigading. Brigading is simply defined as encouraging users from outside the subreddit to enter and disrupt the normal flow of information. As most of you are aware, part-way through the month, the subreddit was swamped with Loopring commenters directed to our subreddit via brigading.

While being directed to the subreddit isn't an abnormal occurrence and we deal with these using individual bans and post removals, the scale of Loopring's brigading was quite unlike anything we've seen so far. As a result, we reached out to moderators on the Loopring subreddit and discord with a request to limit this behaviour. Unfortunately, the requests were not adequately implemented in time and to preserve the integrity of the Cryptocurrency subreddit, Loopring was placed on a temporary blacklist.  

Thankfully we have been in contact with moderators of Loopring social media channels and are working together to prevent further brigading.


#4 - THE HIGHLIGHT  

This is by no means an official badge of endorsement, but every month we will pick what we feel like is a well-written and informative post and plop it here for some extra attention. u/rithpath has made a great little tool that scrapes Reddit looking for mentions of particular Cryptocurrencies. This tool can be used to measure social media sentiment and comes at just the right time as the dawn of discovery of the meme token is upon us. It's also useful for determining a site-wide sentiment, or just the bubbling noise of a few individuals.  

Good job Rithpath! For your excellent post, 1,000 moons will shortly reach your Reddit Vault!

[We spent days building a scraper for cryptocurrency mentions across Reddit in order to find trending coins. Then we put it on a website so everyone can have access! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qqfjgn/we_spent_days_building_a_scraper_for/)

"LRC is great but that is not even close to being true. There are plenty of L2s and sidechains already that scale Ethereum L1. 

For instance, there are other other zk rollups (both STARK and SNARK variety) like zkSync, Polygon Hermez, dYdX, zkSwap, and StarkX. Unlike LRC, zkSync and Hermez are actually full scaling systems for Ethereum, because they support fully generic smart contracts due to having built ZKEVMs. LRC doesn't even have plans to build a ZKEVM (which is considered very hard to do), because their value proposition is not to be able to generically scale Ethereum. They specifically are only intending to scale DEX usage (which makes sense, because that is what their core innovation, order rings, are good for). Of all the zk rollup L2s combined, LRC has less than 1/3 of the TVL.

Then there are optimistic rollup L2s, which are fully EVM compatible, and are currently being used for DeFi way, way, way more than any zk rollup platforms (though I do believe that one day zk will emerge as the superior tech over optimistic). Arbitrum TVL is more than all zk rollup platforms combined **plus** all other optimistic rollup platforms combined **plus** all the validium and plasma L2s combined. Loopring has a little under 9% of all the TVL of L2s on Ethereum.

Then we get into the scaling solutions that aren't L2s, but are instead sidechains like Polygon. Polygon has about the same TVL as **all L2s combined, including Arbitrum**. They also get lower fees than any L2. The downside is that they have worse security than L2s do.

So, in terms of TVL of all scaling solutions on Ethereum, LRC has probably 3 - 4% at most. Unlike Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and others, LRC is **not** EVM compatible, so it can't handle generic smart contracts, and is thus not a full scaling solution for Ethereum. You can't build any part of DeFi on Loopring except DEXes. And finally, while the fees are great, they aren't the lowest of all the scaling solutions.

In conclusion, LRC is great, but there are many other scaling options, of which LRC holds a fairly insignificant portion of the TVL. Many of these other solutions are also full scaling solutions that are fully EVM compatible, which LRC has no intention of being. And don't think that the facts that LRC has a low TVL compared to other scaling solutions and no ZKEVM are explained by LRC being younger than their competition. In fact, LRC launched before almost every other platform that I have mentioned.

All this being said, I imagine LRC will continue to increase their TVL share of the L2s, and the LRC token will probably continue to appreciate. It's probably a great investment. But no, Ethereum does not in any way shape or form rely upon or need LRC.",1636559865,hk2xhdw

Loopring has the wallstreetbets GME apes pumping out memes like clockwork and marketing this plus it actually has way more utility beyond GME and NFT’s.

Of course I'd suggest to do your own research but here's a bit of a summary. Feel free to help me add the sources:


Facts: 


1. Listed as a coin to watch on Greyscale (Canadian retirement fund with $40bn AUM) the previous coin to get accepted 2x'd in the same month. It will get accepted probably in a month or so. Source: Founder on twitter posting screenshot of document from Greyscale



2. Fee-less wallet will launch this week on the L2. So setting up a wallet which currently costs 150usd will become 0. Huge news the moment it's made official. Source: their Dev's on discord 



3. Staking will also be available via their official wallet 



4. Bank of China Patent includes use of LRC as you may be aware of it. 



5. Q4 2021 announcement nearing everyday 



6. Low market cap even now after a good bit of hype around it in the crypto community 



7. GitHub code shows GameStop services mentioned twice. One time regarding export of NFT and later on in the second leak showed their beta testing url (staging server) whose SSL certificate ownership lies with GameStop which makes ties almost confirmed 


8. 10% burn on transaction fees 



9. Exchanges if they want to use loopring need to hold 250k LRC on-chain or 1m LRC off-chain - which means every new exchange on this will reduce the supply of coins on the market driving the price upwards



Opinion:



1. GME announcement about their NFT market place will be a huge 10x event for the coin 



2. Relatively low market cap and wide wallet acceptance will sky rocket the price

Don't Forget the only reason Gamestop got big was that it was a phat meme and great NFT platforms already exist. Also good Layer 2 solutions exist already so none of what you mentioned gives Loopring a unique market advantage. I work in marketing and what you have mentioned here doesn't make me automatically think they have what it takes. And all a low market cap means is that its high-risk high reward. With looping i see more risk than reward.,1636364126,hjsb0lo

You just described optimistic rollup L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism.

You also described zkSync, another zk rollup platform that has already made a zero knowledge EVM (ZKEVM), meaning it have full native smart contract support. Polygon Hermez is also well on it's way to completing a ZKEVM. Loopring is not planning on making a ZKEVM.

I think you're right here except the 'meme coin' comparison. Loopring has been a serious project solving a serious L2 need for ETH.

**Loopring is the crypto snob's Shiba Inu**... A low-cap project with *REAL* utility + all the GME meme hype = a recipe for success. 

We know /r/cryptocurrency is rife with those who don't want to invest in memecoins since ""they don't do anything"" (eg. Doge, Shib). Well this is a perfect recipe of both sides of the coin, mixing the ERC utility/good tokenomics, with Gamestop partnership on the horizon...

I'm interested in the higher speed and reduced fees that Loopring brings to the table. The zkRollups method of bundling transactions together has some great potential and I think the coin could grow even without the GME partnership if that doesn't come to fruition.

For sure. Loopring plans on becoming the backbone of the crypto market. I could see it achieving at least half of bitcoins CURRENT market cap.

"Don't take this as a ""hate"" comment but I felt the same way.

I missed Doge, I missed Shiba, I sold Solana at 30, sold Avax at 20, sold One at 0.09 and completely failed every major big change this Q3 / Q4, my only best investment was Ethereum I bought at lowest point after May and managed to doubled it. 

Now theres another coin which you probably know about. Loopring at 1.2$! My entire portfolio. Did I gambled? Yeah sure, I went for the rumors that I saw here on reddit but now I can't complain myself on seeing the AMAZING tech it has and all the potencial ahead, so I'm holding strong even after beeing my first ever coin at 3x and beyond, this one will be godly tasty in the long term. 

I missed like 9 out of 10 opportunities, big and crazy +10x by selling to early or missing the news and the pump, but not now. I will not lost this chance. You may take this with a grain of salt but your time will eventually come. 

I find 100x almost impossible to find at least for me, I don't have that type of luck even that I know of a few projects with amazing opportunity. Patience and time is what makes a 100x possible mostly, into the right coin if you believe in the fundamentals. Or a shitcoin.",1636904382,hkljarb

However, remember the original intent of an NFT is as a stamp of authentication, just like the deed to your house or title to your car.

If I steal your car... I am in possession of it, I'm using it and driving it and getting all the benefits of having the car. But no matter what, I don't have the title, which is in your name. So it is still your car in every way. 

So NFT's are a similar authentication tool. Now how does commerce find a way to use it? We're starting to see early pioneers into this new world, like the Metaverse or Gamestop and Loopring partnership, etc.",1636902042,hkle59a

"So firstly, it's great that L2s like Loopring are starting to get some attention. The definitely represent the future of most user's blockchain interactions by being fast, cheap and secure.

However, you need to understand a little bit about how they work if you want to understand the potential of your investment, and statements suggesting an Ethereum L2 could end up bigger than the chain it's built on demonstrate you don't really know what you're buying.

Loopring inherits it's security from Ethereum, which is why transaction can be so cheap, users aren't having to pay for their security. It works by bundling up transactions on the rollup layer and just posting the proof into Ethereum mainnet. If the value on Loopring became as high as the value of Ethereum an attacker would be able to pay whatever astronomical sum it cost to attack mainnet and still be in profit.

There are lots of L2s spinning up at the moment: zkSync, Starknet, Loopring, Arbitrum, Optimism, Boba and more. Purely from the perspective of security the total value locked on all of the rollups/volitions/validiums that are built ontop of an L1 can't exceed the cost to attack that L1 (i.e. to buy and sustain 51% of the hashing power of a PoW chain or a controlling share of the staked asset of a PoS chain).

I hope that makes sense, like I said I'm not in any way trying to put down L2s in general or Loopring in particular, just trying to help you understand and have more reasonable expectations!",1636896881,hkl3qa2

"A guy who used to work at Loopring as a developer now works at GameStop as a big wig! Why would they not pair?! This has so much potential that is unreal. Not to mention what Loopring will actually do for the CC world. You’re just and idiot I you don’t invest. IMPO

📣📣The only reason you think this is a “shill coin” is because the apes found out about it  before you did.📣📣 Do some DD.",1636893955,hkkyjph
"Loopring is certainly a promising L2, but I'm still confused about why the LRC token needs to exist in the first place. I understand you need to deposit like 250k LRC if you want to open a DEX on their network, but why not just make people deposit ETH?

Aside from that, there's no staking, no governance, nothing to do with LRC except provide liquidity. So why does it even exist?",1636893617,hkky06g
Loopring to the moon if GME actually makes a NfT marketplace,1636893341,hkkxkf0
Because r/cc and the loopring sub got brigaded by a certain conspiracy subreddit...,1636893230,hkkxe2w
"We talk about most things freely even shit, something must has caused loopring ban",1636893156,hkkx9yw
"For one, old reddit (which has the most robust mod tools) does not show moons. Neither do non official apps like Apollo (which also has good mod tools).  

For two, the users actually banned for brigading were the brigading participants, not longtime users.  

Finally, three, The only longtime users or existing users that have been banned are the ones bypassing the Loopring filter by getting cute and calling it “poop thing” or whatever.  

This can’t get any clearer.",1636640280,hk7d9f0
"Loopring discussion was temporarily halted. We have autofilters in place to prevent users from mentioning Loopring and other similar keywords up until we can get the situation under control from the third parties.  

We very clearly said that attempting to bypass the auto filter will result in a ban. So the *clever* users who have been writing “poop thing”, “➰💍”, “CRL backwards” etc have been getting temporary bans.   

This goes for all users, even long term. Rules are rules.",1636637821,hk787sr
"I wasn’t a mod for the doge, but Shiba was brigaded only on a couple links and we banned a shitload of users. The Loopring thing was too much. Someone just posted a table of the most mentioned coins on the sub and Loopring has more comments than the next 10 cryptos combined. The worst brigading I’ve seen in a long time.",1636629882,hk6vckq
"You’re totally and utterly wrong. Did you read the thread we posted yesterday? Most times, projects get brigaded. We receive reports on these and usually just action the accounts.  

This time, we were under multiple concurrent brigades from several sources. This is against Reddit’s site-wide policy and risks having the subreddit suspended or removed.  

Please try and drop your emotion and bias and look at it objectively. Look at our Rules on the sidebar regarding manipulation. If a project suffers continual brigading and attempts at vote manipulation, it is temporarily blacklisted.  

Loopring isn’t the first project this has happened to and I’m sure it won’t be the last. Vote manipulation is bad and again, it’s against Reddit’s sitewide rules and we have to enforce it.  

I get that you’re disappointed, but it’s only temporary. Please keep a cool head and look at it objectively. It’s nothing to do with perceived moderator bias or anything like that. It’s about protecting the sub.",1636628249,hk6t7zq
"Thank you. I’ve had to say it a million times. We’re all super stoked when people make money, or projects complete really cool upgrades or partnerships - it legitimises and strengthens the crypto community.  

What undermines the community is when bad actors attempt to circumvent Reddit’s site wide rules. One of these is vote manipulation. By directing people to come to our sub and spam Loopring, and to “upvote everything Loopring you see” this is brigading and vote manipulation. Reddit has removed entire subreddits for this, therefore it’s in everyone’s interest to place a temporary halt on this until the other sides moderators get it under control.  

This has happened twice before with Safemoon, once or twice with IOTA, with Nano and Banano. It’s not about mods liking or disliking projects - we moderate with objectivity and not bias. It’s about protecting the subreddit and making it a pleasant place for the users.  

I’m sure that when the Loopring mods on discord and subreddit put actions in place to deal with brigades, we can remove the halt and people can continue excitedly talking up their gains. We love that genuine community interaction.  


We’re not interested in seeing a bunch of zombie accounts, or accounts with 0 prior posting history, coming in here and clogging it up. And I’d bet our long-term users aren’t interested either, regardless of their personal holdings.  

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",1636627993,hk6swld
"In your own words, why do you think we temporarily halted discussion on Loopring?",1636627605,hk6sf3q
You guys sure do like to misrepresent your argument. It’s not going to change anything. Loopring discussion has been temporarily halted due to ongoing brigading. The moderators of the loopring subreddit have started addressing this as per our request yesterday.,1636627511,hk6sat9
"Brigading is when people are directed to our sub for the express purpose of pushing a narrative. Shilling is just people excited about their shit. There’s a lot of loopring shilling and we just ignore it. People are happy it’s up whatever percent and that’s cool, we’re not here to rain on that parade. When we receive many, many reports showing us people are encouraging stuff like “go on cryptocurrency reddit and upvote everything loopring you can” and then also sharing links to loopring posts, that’s where we draw the line.",1636623981,hk6o5z3

"When Loopring comes out with its counterfactual wallet you'll be able to buy ETH and other tokens with cash/credit within Ethereum's LRC L2 network. 

Coinbase is adding support for Matic soon and you'll be able to custody ETH on the Matic blockchain for a lot less than keeping it on the ETH blockchain.

After you're in an L2 any token swaps after are cents and it's cheap to bridge from L2 to other L2's. Matic and Zksync are coming out with EVM compatible L2's that should plug into any ETH dApp soon, Matic and Arbitirium already have lots of app support. 

The caveat is you need to pay those ETH fees if you want to bridge any of those assets onto L1 ever again. As time goes on (and gas grows more expensive) this will become less necessary as CEXs enable L2 support. **If you can buy ETH that's already on an L2 you'll save yourself so many problems.**


Right now fees to move ETH are around $3-5. If that's too much it'll likely be too much to *use* ETH for anything complicated also, currently, but that's what L2's were made for. If you're just speculating on ETH I'd recommend holding it in a CEX as gas prices are going to only grow, at least until Coinbase or Binance etc. add more L2 support.",1638646112,hn89z8v

"unpopular opinion: loopring will most likely have the same trajectory as cardano. I am assuming there’ll be a few people from gamestop $GME who are here due to the rumours/ speculations. as cliché as it sounds, “buy the rumour, sell the news” is always plausible.

for those of you who aren’t aware, cardano was one of the most hyped coin back in August 2021 (yes, VERY recently) and everyone was going crazy for it. predictions of $10 and above quickly flooded the r/cc daily discussion and everyone had such optimistic view of it. fast forward to today, the price had a MASSIVE 50% DROP from ATH and gone were the days of those ‘bullish’ on cardano. sounds familiar?

it’s terrifying how this is the exact pattern playing out for loopring especially with the influx of people who do not have prior knowledge on crypto markets. (search $ADA and $XRP for example to understand what I mean). I know it’s hard to believe it, but please do not regret when it doesn’t ‘moon’ as you wish because you might be in for a disappointment. if you are just playing with some extra cash, then that’s definitely fine since you are not needing the money anyway. if otherwise, please take a step back and reflect.

I have personally experienced this so I am just trying to help others to not be in my situation where I went from 100K of profits to a mere 2K profits because I didn’t have the foresight to see this as another $ADA.

*disclaimer: I’m neither a bull/ bear (out of the market) but I just want to warn people to put money that you can afford to LOSE. while I have a pessimistic view of LRC (based on ADA 50% halving cycle), do NOT go short it because it can always go either way.

while I make this “unpopular opinion” which is indisputably controversial, I am NOT advising people to sell. I am trying to get them to reflect on their actions.

do a remind me two months later and see if I’m right/ wrong. do compare to $ADA too

I’m not a crypto expert by any means, but from what I’ve been seeing it’s a very solid layer 2 option that should help to circumvent ETH gas fees.

LOOPRING PROTOCOL IS REMARKABLY PERFORMANT

Loopring solves scalability without compromising Ethereum security. Our zkRollup throughput reaches approximately 1000x of Ethereum, or as high as 2,025 trades per second. The cost per transaction is reduced to as little as 1/100th the cost of Ethereum, with trades and transfers costing fractions of a cent. With Loopring, we expect non-custodial exchanges and payment apps to continue outcompeting and displacing centralized ones.

Ethereum has become so popular and heavily used, that it exists in a near-permanent state of congestion, where users face absurdly high fees and long delays. Layer 2 presents a less congested fast lane, where users transact gas-free and without delay, yet completely coupled to Ethereum security. From a user's POV, it just works, with blockchain UX problems abstracted. Loopring's performance is sufficient for algorithmic traders and market makers to deploy legacy-style, HFT strategies on DEXes for the first time.",1638618176,hn6oxc9

If a post on this sub gets 5k upvotes and if we assume every single one of those 5k upvoters believe it like religion, those 5k users represent 0.02% of crypto owners at best in the USA only, not counting the rest of the world.

If you understand that you can't possibly make every trade and that hitting the perfect low on every buy and the perfect high on every sale is impossible, missing out is not that hard.

If you chase and fall for a rugpull or paperhand because of a dip that scared you, you don't only hate that you lost/missed money, you also hate yourself for having made a bad decision. Stings double.

Don't try to make more good decisions, try to make less bad ones. It's the better approach to optimization.

I did not miss it. I decided not to buy it, when the time to buy it was the right one.

The difference between Starkware, Miden and ZkSync is the level of compatability. Whereas Starkware and Miden run on their own virtual machines (VM), ZkSync is focused on full-E(Ethereum)VM compatibility. This will probably affect developers the most.

"Polygon is a side chain,  not L2. Also, there is a lot of competition in the layer 2 sphere (also from cheap layer 1s). The most popular layer 2 doesn't even have a coin btw (Arbitrum).

One rumor is not going to push a project like that, isn't even a huge rumor anyway and it will def be a classic ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" thing.

Loopring is also quite an old coin and finally surpassed it's ATH from 2018 like a week or two ago. In that time they never got any traction or things that are being used. Seems to me they are overhyped out of nowhere.",1638226427,hml9t0q

I think you're at just as much risk on any of those 3 exchanges.

&gt;I'm looking forwards for proper DEX to come around.

Which is why I'm so bullish on Loopring! Their new L2 wallet will effectively become an almost feeless Ethereum/ERC20 DEX. Well, you still have to pay gas fees once to get your funds into the system, but they're working on a direct fiat on- and off-ramp !",1638203662,hmjpesu

ETH2.0 will solve a lot of issues, but it isn't infinitely scalable by itself, and if the ecosystem was to continue growing like it almost certainly will, there will always be need for other scaling solutions with different confirmation speeds and fees and so on, and that would be L2 solutions or side chains.

I have no “point to prove” other than that your conviction that there couldn’t *possibly* be a partnership between these two organizations, based on only one fact while blatantly ignoring many others, is both premature and ignores known evidence that suggests otherwise.

Based on information provided directly by each company, there *will* be a partnership soon between loopring and *somebody*. And there most likely *will* be an NFT marketplace released by gamestop in the near future. This, alone, is enough evidence to consider the possibility that these two projects *could* be connected. I am not drawing any conclusion here. I am just saying that it is **possible.**

You, however, are stating as *absolute fact* that this partnership could not possibly exist. But other than stating that erroneous code on GitHub contributed to the hype, you’ve presented no eveidence to support your conclusion. 

So unless you can add anything of substance to your argument that “there is no Gamestop
marketplace coming,” it would appear that *you* are the one who is looking for something just to try to prove their point.",1638779208,hnfrip6

"We’re still good, my friend. LRC to $5 eventually. After the Loopring/Gamestop announcement.

The pinned post on /r/loopringorg is very thorough and convincing.  
  
Meme-coin hype. GME-hardened buy &amp; holders guaranteeing a slowly rising floor. Imminent FOMO-causing announcements. Vitalik’s seal of approval. Actual real-use cases that synergize with Ethereum and give it real general public/mainstream potential.  
  
All the boxes are checked for LRC, in my opinion.  
  
Nothing is 100%, but LRC has everything I hoped it would when looking for a crypto that wasn’t just speculative short-term, which also translates to the best-case scenario of least amount of downsides and risks for a crypto investment.  
  
It’s good stuff.",1638774647,hnflpu4

Loopring has as much as said they’ve got a partnership with someone big in the works, and gamestop has all but said that they’re coming out with an NFT marketplace. And they’ve been hiring developers with crypto experience like crazy recently. It would fit very well that both organizations are dropping hints about the same project. 

Until either one of them makes a big move in *without* the other as a partner, I think it’s a bit premature to say that “there’s no gamestop partnership coming.”",1638772587,hnfituw

He reminds me of every high school kid who gets way too ahead of himself and starts talking shit about things he *thinks* will happen in the future.

"Lots of stuff to nitpick but otherwise, good writing. Short and simple.

-	Binance being Chinese as an issue is sort of hilarious and maybe discriminatory (?) and also doesn’t make sense since CZ is basically anti-Chinese (BSC still not in a great position being phased out by other L1s and getting caught up by other CEXes)
-	They Solana team did not take down the network , the validators did. They also have one of the highest number of validators. (Solana can still be criticized tho for tendencies to mismanage and high barrier of entry regarding validators)
-	Cardano did not prioritize cheap and fast transactions, they prioritized security and decentralization as well as UX (see Babel fees). In fact, they’re not actually scalable yet despite the release of smart contracts. Their roadmap for scalability will come later next year or 2023 with hydra.
-	I seriously doubt Avalanche is the fastest blockchain
-	Polygon PoS doesn’t necessarily compete with Rollups like Loopring, Arbitrum, Optimism. They’re different products. They’re building “competitors” though in Midan, Nightfall, and Hermez + one more unannounced solution.  
-	Polygon PoS also doesn’t ‘enhance the Ethereum network’ with it being a side chain that leverages MATIC. That was why it was criticized for the community before they released their roadmap for building an L2 ecosystem. They, more accurately, leverage Ethereum’s security and validation.",1638752563,hneewju

"https://l2fees.info/

Fees are already being fixed on rollups, so your question is kind of like asking what happens to Tesla if they can't improve the perfomance of electric cars...

The cost to swap ERC20 tokens on Ethereum mainnet is about $35 at the moment, the cost to do so on Optimism's rollup (for example) is about $3, so a reduction of more than 90%.

As you mentioned, ZK rollups will be even cheaper, and with an even better security proposition. StarkNet, which released this week for devs might be the first general purpose ZK, though it's not there yet, and Polygon (who despite what you may have heard are infact part of the Ethereum ecosystem) are having a ZK rollup conference next Friday. LoopRing are also working on EVM compatibity for ZK rollups and I'm sure other teams like zkSync are doing so as well.

The biggest hurdle to lower fees is just going to be educating users, but the understanding will spread out eventually. In the end normal users will never transact directly on Ethereum L1, it'll just provide security for the ecosystem of rollups built on it and they will be pisting their SNARKs, STARKs and Fraud Proofs as basically the only L1 transactions. Mainnet will also provide sharded data accessibility, meaning ZK Rollups will be able to scale far more than they can now, with the ecosystem in the long term being able to handle millions of TPS, and therefor providing the infinitesimally low fee transactions for users without sacrificing decentralization or security.

It's a big plan, but we're further along it than most people realize. The TL:DR is that fees are already lower on rollups, some of which you can access directly from exchanges already.",1638709535,hnbifrl
"Personally, I don't think so for a few years regardless of staking.

I think it's more to do with the public consciousness. Sure, the majority of people in technologically advanced countries know Bitcoin. Some may know Ethereum. But how many would know Cardano, Solana, VeChain, Loopring, etc. 

When people think of crypto, they think Bitcoin. And naturally this means that it receives the most amount of attention and investment in the crypto space.

I think the masses need to start seeing cryptocurrency as a whole host of protocols, utility, currencies and technologies beyond just Bitcoin for this decoupling to occur. When this happens, I believe we'll see a more segmented market where DeFi moves together, Smart contracts move together, Gaming, AI, etc. 

Give it a few years. I believe this change in public consciousness will start to occur if/when ETH flips BTC, people will go ""oh wait there's other crypto's?"" And maybe the market will start to even out with multiple trillion dollar cap coins or not such a difference in market cap between the number 1 placed coin and number 10 or 50 for example.",1638705349,hnbcqvx

"I believe there is a ""lost-in-translation"" on this. When they say ""The LRC Token associated with Loopring *accounts for* 68% of TVL."" they mean it makes up that amount, not literal ""accounts"". 

Loopring is a Defi Protocol, and it uses multiple cryptocurrencies, including its own LRC cryptocurrency, to together provide for this platform. So what they are trying to say is ""Out of ALL the value that Loopring provides (in tokens, staking, rewards, etc.), 68% is already being used up by their LRC token. Another way of thinking about it would be that there is only 32% of value REMAINING in Loopring tokens, because the other 68% is already ""in use and locked"".

Many people look at TVL as a metric for when a project is doing good. Obviously the more value locked up in a project, the better it is (in theory). But on the flip ide, it also is an indicator that so much of a projects value has already been purchased, that there is not as much remaining to get yourself a piece of the pie.",1635966540,hj6p6wd

Gamestop could do the same or just charge them $1 or whatever they need to charge.

We don't know how LRC is implementing an NFT marketplace, I'm using ImmutableX as a likely comparison point.

Have you ever used any roll-up? The data sits on ETH L1 but data still gets posted to a ""sidechain"" before it rolls up to L1. You bridge assets into Arbitrum, Optimism, and LRC.

Bridges usually work by burning/locking tokens on one chain and minting/unlocking on another chain, which cost smart contract gas fees on both chains. For Layer 2, the network fees will be negligible.

For example a theoretical case in which Loopring adds the Solana network to its platform:

- Send Solana to Loopring's Solana wallet.
- Loopring burns the Solana and creates new ERC-20 tokens on Layer 2.
- You only pay the Solana network fees.

It is a more centralized-solution since the transaction is partially-off chain. Also, Loopring is currently just on the Ethereum network.",1635955629,hj5wcbl

ZkRollups will be the next big thing..look at MATIC purchasing MIR today because they are doing catchup in the ZkRollup space. Loopring has been working in this for nearly 6 years and are #1 in this space in my opinion.
Aside deom that, they are also working on a new wallet release, direct fiat onramp.

You could use a CEX (centralized exchange) to trade crypto
or you could eliminate the third party risk, custody your own funds + get PAID to trade crypto on Ethereum (Layer 2) with zero fees. This is looprings mission.

My largest gain came from Polygon, I heavily invested bc I liked what I read. (Still an amazing project w/ a very bright future) but let’s be honest, we’re also here for money.  My track record has been above par in trading around… that being said I dropped all my alt coins and dumped into Loopring @$1.00.  The plan was to ride the wave and re-invest back into the other projects I was bullish on.  But as of right now, the more I read on LRC, the more I’m tempted to keep everything in.  (Other than all my OG Eth) And as of right now, that’s exactly what I’m doing.  

I’m no expert, but I’ve been here for several years.  Between the hype and the room for MC growth… I can see this going into top 20.  I see it moving to $8-$12 this run around.  (All speculation, and obviously null if we go into a premature bear)",1639096850,hnxa21b

I would say the next big play is Ethereum L2 protocols. It’s hard to say which one will win, but I believe one or more of these L2 tokens will gain a lot of value. 

Personally, I’m most bullish on zkEVM compatible L2 systems. This would be Polygon, zkSync and StarkNet. Next best would be EVM compatible optimistic Rollups such as Arbitrum and Optimism. 

Unfortunately most of these don’t have tokens to invest in, so I currently only own Polygon and will definitely be buying zkSync when it’s release. If StarkNet releases a token, I would buy that too. 

L2 systems that have a token right now that I’m currently not investing in include Loopring and ImmutableX - because these are not EVM compatible meaning that they do not support smart contracts.",1639000564,hnrukt6

"Depends on how you see it.

If you like ETH's security, then you will like LRC for resolving gas fees.

ETH gas fees becomes more expensive the more people use it. Big problem.

Loopring's zkRollups, though, solves this by bundlinh up orders into one. So a $100 fee for one person could instead be shared by 100 people to make it only cost $1—so it becomes the reverse: the more people who uses, the cheaper gas fees become.

Recently, the Loopring team now claims that trading in their system is not only free—but also earns you 0.2% rebate.

Now, it becomes a matter of mass adoption which all Looptroopers are waiting for—the multitude of announcements (GameStop partnership, NFT marketplace, direct on-ramp buying in the L2 without multiple transfers, counterfactual wallet, etc) to make it mainstream.

Algorand, meanwhile, is already a fully functional coin without the hang ups of its peers. The trilemna that haunted every other asset is its trifecta: security, decentralization, and cost. Every aspect of it is already excellent, so it doesn't need a project like LRC to cover its weaknesses.

*Loopring runs on the Ethereum network, specifically on layer 2 zero knowledge rollups (zkRollups). Layer 2 refers to a secondary protocol that builds on top of an existing system, in this case, on top of Ethereum. ZkRollups allow blockchains to validate transactions faster whilst ensuring that gas fees are minimal. They combine processes handled both on-blockchain and off-blockchain.*  
  
*ZkRollups are becoming increasingly popular among developers, investors and traders looking for faster and cheaper transaction processing.*

**Why it is a hype now?**

*Rumours of GameStop partnership.*",1639404479,hodoplu

"Keep the vast majority in ETH and BTC until you learned more. Don't follow Reddit blindly, often when things are being hyped up here it's already too late, like when ADA was the flavor of the month and it just kept going down. Or SOLANA being shittalked for a month and then it did a 10x or something. CRO was also largely ignored for months until it pumped.

Then again, Loopring got on this sub pretty early and gave people profits, but mostly things don't go that well.  

Research about what makes coins great. Don't do what influencers on tiktok and Youtube tell you.  

Many other things, but mostly do research, learn about crypto so you can then learn about what makes coins good and if you should invest or not.",1639698953,houkhnw

"I know you’ll laugh but here’s how I did it:

- Go through Reddit, it needs to have its own Reddit thread and be mentioned multiple crypto threads such as this

- look at their market cap, look compare it to other projects of its kind. Look how their prices correlate to their work, like milestones reached and the price fluctuations.

- Go through their website and judge how they explain their concept and introduce themselves, basically their vision. Read their whitepaper if I’m really interested. Basically see if their project solves an important problem

- look at the devs and the people behind the project, properly want to have some well known people with credentials

That’s it, At the end I need to believe in the project and the community. Been into crypto since 2016. now before you call me out, these are the projects:

- ADA at 0.20 
- ANKR at 0.008 (still far from pumping, it will soon)
- CRO at 0.4
- LTC at 3.0
- Nano at 1.5 or so back in 2016/17
- XRP also in the same year at 0.10 or so

Im literally doing the same shit I did for these coins atm:

- Loopring 
- FTM
- ANKR
- Oasis / Rose
- ALGO 
- ONE

I think you can see the pattern.",1639687146,hotrtwi

I do look at TA a bit and do my own, but mostly I'm just really good at identifying patterns and doing research. Some coins have a perfect storm of shit breaking lose around them and you have to believe it when you see and put your money in. You also have to pull it out when you are up and not be greedy. I sold Doge at .40 and watched it run up, but I 10xed and that's great. I could have made more on most. But a bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush. I'm still holding Loopring.",1639686942,hotrb3b

I think if you can get tokens for any projects that don’t currently have them but are ethereum L2 scaling solutions (which loopring LRC) is then you’re good. Some tokens will leverage other projects like ethereum. Some will have other viral aspects. Some will have communities that collide. Loopring has all this and more and is only at $3bn market cap so it’s a solid buy in my opinion.. this one’s gonna do well if the fundamentals hold up,1639679988,hot9kie

MATIC is a side-chain, making the security be inferior.


Loopring for example is not a side-chain, therefore it has the same security as the main Ethereum chain.",1639659650,horx4hz
"You're essentially describing sharding. The ETH chain will break into 64 chains that will communicate via ZKrollups, similiar tech to what Hermez or Loopring uses.

Polygon is only a sidechain also, different from a L2. It maintains its own security and has less than ETH L1. A true L2 uses the same security as L1.

As gas prices increase this will be the inevitable outcome anyway. Nobody is going to pay $1000 to move funds in the future especially after more fiat on/off ramps and CEXs begin supporting L2s. But they have the choice anyway, which is important because every transaction is indiscriminate.",1639659095,horw565

"One regret was selling a bunch of random alts into BTC sometime in early 2021. I really don’t care about those projects, but in hindsight it would have been wiser to wait  longer than I did. My philosophy late 2020 was to buy random small lots of alts, e.g. Loopring, Chainlink, MakerDAO, Tezos, Compound, Uniswap, etc. in preparation for “alt season”. Some were dogs and still haven’t really done much, but others were doing pretty good when I sold them, and then proper exploded after I sold. 

Nothing wrong with putting some money in your pocket while looking for the next opportunity. Crypto does offer some crazy gains during a bull run, but there are thousands of other markets out there where someone can make money with some planning and discipline. Do not think that this was (or is) your “one shot” at living a decent life. That mindset is toxic. It prevents you from finding more practical ways of earning money and pushes you into high risk/low reward situations at the worst of times.

#1 - SUBREDDIT CHANGES  

Following two out of four successful governance polls, I can confirm that comments are now sorted by 'New' for posts submitted, for a short while, until returning to the default sorting option. In addition, the ability to submit Live posts has been disabled, as users were mistakenly submitting these not knowing what they were. Some fairly uncontroversial governance polls, so if you do think of anything you think may be beneficial, please do submit it to /r/cryptocurrencymeta.


We also passed 4 Million members, although ""flew by"" may be more appropriate as we are now approaching 4.2 Million. Looks like the 5 Million subs Moons giveaway will be coming faster than we think! Congratulations again to the three lucky winners of /u/jwinterm giveaway who scored 5,000 Moons each.

#2 - AMA's  

[AMA section incoming later today!]

#3 - MANIPULATION  

It's not just Moons that are the objective for Manipulation, but often a desire to see a certain narrative or inflated popularity pushed. We realise that some of you have made financial decisions based off advice in this subreddit - at least to some capacity. And therefore it's important that we try and keep discussions natural. If something is popular - then it's popular!

However, we have very strict rules around brigading. Brigading is simply defined as encouraging users from outside the subreddit to enter and disrupt the normal flow of information. Once again we have had to deal with a concerted attempt to manipulate the subreddit from Loopring, and are talking with Loopring officials &amp; moderators on how to deal with this going forward. The last thing we want to do is silence discussion of a legitimate and mature Cryptocurrency, but we expect the bearers of that Cryptocurrency to act the same way.

While being directed to the subreddit isn't an abnormal occurrence and we deal with these using individual bans and post removals, I'd just like to remind everyone that project-level blacklists occur when the scale of Vote Manipulation and Brigading are too widespread for Moderators to adequately deal with.


We are also noticing some patterns of behaviour around how people understand the limitations of the current karma system, and are finding... creative... ways around it to earn more Moons. Please may I remind everyone reading that the community voted and passed [CCIP-007](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mrn758/15000_karma_cap_on_moon_distribution/) which limits the amount of karma an individual can accrue in one distribution period. If you are unsatisfied with this limit, please propose a new limit in the /r/Cryptocurrencymeta subreddit, otherwise any attempts to bypass this will be met with a Cryptocurrency ban as well as a referral to Reddit Admins to check for any breaches of Reddit's ToS, resulting in a site-wide ban.


#4 - THE HIGHLIGHT  

This is by no means an official badge of endorsement, but every month we will pick what we feel like is a well-written and informative post and plop it here for some extra attention. u/M00OSE has made a great little tool that scrapes Reddit looking for mentions of particular Cryptocurrencies. This tool can be used to measure social media sentiment and comes at just the right time as the dawn of discovery of the meme token is upon us. It's also useful for determining a site-wide sentiment, or just the bubbling noise of a few individuals.  

Good job M00OSE! For your excellent post, 1,000 moons will shortly reach your Reddit Vault!

"Loopring has a functioning Zk-rollup protocol and can now be purchased directly via their fiat to layer 2 ETH on-ramp. There aren’t any other cryptos that offer this. 
It has the potential to be a successful and dominant L2 solution for ethereum and vitalik has mentioned it specifically in the past as a viable solution. Recently vitalik posted this “Endgame” roadmap which discusses possible future outcomes for layer 2 tech. Loopring is currently working with the Ethereum Foundation. If Loopring can successfully solve the “trilemma” of ETH problems, it may become a very successful L2.

"&gt; Polygon merge/bought alot of zk rollups technology and is the leader in the zk field.

???? lmao no they are not. They are fairly behind on Zk tech. Starkware, Matter Labs and Loopring all have a significant lead when it comes to Zk rollups. ZkSync (Matter Labs) have their zkEVM running on the testnet. Same goes with Starknet &amp; Starkex (starkware). While loopring was founded(2017) much earlier than the formers, they've already been working on zkEVM. 

All Polygon did was buy 2 zk centric L2's and barely developing their own zk tech.

"Good points, I think “blue chips” should have a representative in their “niche” (yes crypto by design wears many hats, so I’m just talking gene pop understandings of them). So the metrics here are more about continued cycle survival and likely future growth regardless of high volatility prices. Note doesnt mean they are all great investments.. apple stock is a blue and so a boeing.. but holding apple for 10 years i figure has gotten much better returns. Same apllies to crypto and I’d say the timing of when u bought plays hugely on future profitability and return. You bigball it and buy in crypto winters you make out great, u buy late bull markets.. might take year to be profitable etc..

Store of value: BTC and I would put LTC as a second here. Im not saying LTC would hold value in a bear market but its proven it has staying power, it will always be around. In bull markets it always recovers well enough. 

Value transfer: XLM, and pending court stuff XRP. Id put LTC in there to as its uniquitous across most exchanges and always good liquidity. Otheriwse xlm/xrp are phenomenal at sending stuff across exchanges, wallets, whatever. Nano isnt here because though its amazing, its just not supported enough across exchanges etc. it needs to be in more places. 

Smart bois: ETH is a given, but competitors are rising to try and eat some market share. Theres only so much money floating around and the network effect is real. More active wallets, more money, more developers, a virtuous cycle. After ETH the question falls to how is next in line, who can be considered a core smart contract protocol. At this time I’d say Cardano but honestly they’ve stumble out of the smart contract gate so idk whats happening with them. So they’re interesting but not “blue chip”. Otherwise the distinctions between smart comtract protocols get hand wavy as they will all grow to have L2, sharding, defi.. etc 

SM sharding bois: this is up for grabs, and who knows hwo it all works out. Was gonna throw in “interoperability” in there too but whatever: at this time I see 3 main players: cosmos, polkadot, avalanche. All three amazing projects.. im partial to dot but whatever.. none are “blue chip” yet, they all have much proving to do but all on the right path. 

L2 eth: none considered blue chip but matic(polygon) is getting there. So a sub eth category - i mean only a couple notables: matic, loopring as of late but ask anybody pre gme and wasnt no mosts radar at all. I think do to shitty tokenomics but regarldess if they proove themselves that can only be great for the overall eth ecosystems. Honestly though all L2 will have to play with each other so as to never have a user forced to use the L1 eth chain otherwise getting obliterated by fees. Theres optimism, arbitum but they dont have tokens so whatever (starkwave too i guess in the group). 

Oracles: link. Totally a blue chip. I mean they have manged to really dominate their sector, very impressive. 

Data storage: nobody id consider blue chip - filecoin, arweave leaders in their use cases.. I think. 

Memecoins: strange beast they are. I honestly think calling them memecoin undercuts their positive contributions to crypto as a whole. Divisive? sure. Silly? Yeah. Have grown huge followings that for one has stuck and only grown since 2015? Yup. Doge. Silly as it sounds, its probably done more for crypto than we give it credit. Now for my hot take: Yes i think its a blue chip. It will never die, it has legacy, an Og of its own sector but also offered everywhere and serves as a decent transfer like ltc in a pinch. Otherwise there are “memecoins” like the that play off, while Doge is more a “community coin” and so bigger than a simple meme. Id put meme coin to shib.. so but we need to see its staying power over years to come to a determination on its status. 

Tons of other sectors of crypto im blanking on: for defi, like aave, compound. Dexes uniswap.. a case could be made that they are bluechisp but they are so new, they could be outclassed by newer stuff etc also i dont find defi token inherently investable given their limited ise cases but well see how defi2.0 shapes up. 

Cefi Stablecoins: usdt,usdc yeah they both blue chisp evern if everybody hates usdt.. hey even Leahmens Brothers was a I think considered blue chip stock in the banking sector before it collapses.. so um yeah .

Programatical stablecoins: partial to defi2 ish.. cool new stuff there but so early. Luna/ust is awesome, maker/dai awesome.. probably a bunch more that will see how they evolve. I do think the most important flippening to occurr in crypto is ust/dai type tokens to overtage cefi stablecoins. But thats just me. 

Cheers.",1640208336,hpltu4h
"Truth, but how are you diversifying? At least one should be a store of value (like BTC, ETH), others can be something like L2 side chains (like Polygon, Loopring, etc.) or crypto payment projects such as AMP, or others.

"Feeling pretty good about buying spg yesterday. Bought more this morning is still going up and up. They are going to release alot of play to earn gaming stuff in january. Just got listed on coinmarketcap. Might not be the next big thing but is certainly my biggest today. 
Rainmaker games looks cool, said to be the Netflix of metaverse gaming. Launched on auction last week, trading on uniswap and pancakeswap ATM. Has some good partnerships and is pretty cheap at the moment. Interested to see what they develop and how many exchange listings they get. Staking just went live and the starting rate is 1000% apy, although I'm sure they will cut that in half or more soon, certainly is good at the moment. That one might actually have some good potential to be a player in the space. 

Atari token actually I think could be a big thing. They have substantial land in sandbox already from early investment. A world in decentraland and axie infinity partnership. As well as many other metaverse partnerships.  Almost harder to find a gaming metaverse they Don't have a stake in. Atari is also building an ""alphaverse"" of their own and their 50th anniversary is next year. I believe they will market very hard and have their metaverse ready by then. Their smart wallet also allows for swaps with no gas fees apparently. I haven't really tried that feature. Once it gets more exchange listings and what not though would definitely increase the market cap.  They are looking to be a universal currency across metaverse platforms. Animoca games is a big company that has the rights now to develop classic Atari games on blockchain. They have set profit goals and will have to reach those by certain dates. Binance also just recently invested alot into Animoca towards gaming development.


I guess the common theme here is metaverse gaming. That is what I think will be the next big thing. If someone makes a Good rpg where all items are nft tokens and can be sold easily, that will be a game changer. 

Naturally you also got the loopring and other rollups such as Matic as potential next big thing as well. erc-20 swaps will be big once metaverse and nft marketplaces start accepting multiple different tokens. Most people have heard enough about that so I won't get much into it in this sub. 

Anyway worth researching if you want some things to look into.

On another note radioshack has a token going into an initial auction next week. Looks heavy on staking and token swaps. I might jump on board a little, I haven't researched that one fully to my appropriate levels but the owners of RadioShack also helped develop atlas usv which is their big partner that the coin will be built on top of.

"Dope technical stuff is coming to solved these problems, off the top of my head these two things will have the biggest impact:

A rollup (ImmutableX, loopring, etc) can keep the data that's pertinent for today off-chain except for the important bit of proof of ownership that gets committed on-chain for the immutable/decentralized/censorship-resistant aspect. That way there's no more data being committed on the blockchain than necessary. There's even volition rollups that allow the user to decide if they want all of the data to be committed on the blockchain, which of course will cost more than a centralized data storage solution, but if it's important data the increased security will be worth it to them. 

And on the base layer, stuff like state and history expiry will cut the bloat of unnecessary data from years ago when nobody really cares about it. The actual data is deleted from the blockchain, but there remains a cryptographic proof that would allow someone to prove that the data *was* there if they have the data and want to ""bring it back to life"" and use it for some other stuff. And even then it's only ""deleted"" in that individual nodes aren't expected to keep that data available, but stuff like block explorers and archival services will still keep a full record of the blockchain, it just won't bloat the entire thing after decades of accumulated data. It doesn't make sense to expect every node to keep terabytes of state/history data that isn't used anymore, but these terabytes will still be available through some other means.",1640417124,hpw9w0u

"Yes, [anywhere from a 9x reduction to a 40x reduction for token swaps](https://l2fees.info/), which are considered one of the more expensive transactions you can perform.

L2s (specifically rollups, which are the most promising type of L2 scaling) work by basically taking transactions and processing them off the Ethereum blockchain, then posting information regarding them back onto the Ethereum blockchain in a highly compressed form, allowing many L2 transactions to fit within a single L1 transaction.

The cost of the single L1 transaction is effectively divided between all the L2 transactions, which drives fees down the more people are using the L2, until the L2 maxes out the amount of L2 transactions it can fit within a single L1 transaction (though there are plans to expand the amount of data an L1 transaction can contain, which would allow more L2 transactions to fit within a single L1 transaction).

You'll need to pay the full cost of an L1 fee to get into an L2 via a bridge (or you'll need to move your funds to an exchange that supports direct withdrawals to an L2), but once you're in an L2, you'll be able to take advantage of the reduced fees, especially if the L2 you're using is general-purpose, like Arbitrum or Optimism (some L2s are special-purpose, such as Loopring or zkSync, and so you can only do what the L2 supports, which is often just transfers and swaps).

If you want to move to another L2 or go back to the L1 network, then you can use bridges like [Hop](https://hop.exchange/) to do so, again taking advantage of the reduced fees. If you're going back to the L1 network, once your funds are in the L1 network, you're back to paying full priced L1 fees, so just keep that in mind.",1640147391,hpio9yk

"I spent all day today trying to learn about defi platforms to earn yield from liquidity pools. 

All I wanted to do was experiment with wBTC-ETH pools, but god damn, layer 2s do not appear to be the solution for that. It still costs like &gt;$100 to deposit into any of the layer 2s like matic, arbitrum, or loopring. Arbitrum and loopring are jokes for pools available, I couldn't find anything remotely comparable in profitability to the eth-btc pairs on uniswap ir pancakeswap. Only with sushiswap through matic did I find a decent lair to earn, but that was still oy lile 4% APY, which you can earn more through simple cefi. 

Same deal with all the eth-killer defi protocols. Nothing but a bunch of no-name scam projects or stable coin pairs, only saw a few eth-btc pairs out there and the interwst yield was junk, like 1%.

"Don't worry, you won't see high gas fees when you use Loopring, StarkNet and zkSync",1637168600,hl0au9d
"Expensive gas fees will always be the nature of Layer 1.  It's what provides the security to the system.  Luckily with zkRollups all users are going to be able to metaphorically carpool and split the gas cost.  Complaining about the gas fee's now is kind of pointless because within the year multiple layer 2 zkRollup platforms like Optimism, loopring, arbitrum will be the defacto chains for most users. Once those layer 2 systems are interoperable and stacked on top of the POS Beacon Chain and sharded. You're looking at millions of transactions per second.

To build more on the car metaphor Ethereum Proof of Stake chain is like the direction of the highway (it makes sure everyone is going the same direction and is safe), the sharded system is the number of lanes on the highway (1024 shards), bundled zkrollup transactions are cars that everyone rides in, then everyone splits the gas to get to their destination.

We already have zkrollups to an extent and those are able to alleviate some amount of congestion at the moment, and it makes sense that these would be first because these are probably the easiest to implement on top of the current chain structure.  That being said switching from the current Proof of Work to the Proof of Stake system is an incredible delicate process and rightfully so.  If they fuck up the transition to POS and cause a consensus problem or contracts can get exploited or any might happen with a POS bug, ethereum potentially goes to zero.

I would much rather keep our expensive transactions and wait for the secure and safe systems they have been working to build for the last 5-6 years.

 A company has a firesale on a literal store of value? 'Whoa, what the fuck is happening omg!!?!?!'

"I've posted this elsewhere but I'll just copy paste and hope it helps!

&gt; **Bad news**: 'ETH 2.0' ([which has been deprecated more or less](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/p9td6q/eth_20_is_deprecated_nomenclature_were_one/)), specifically the merge, won't directly lower fees. Block times will be a tad faster I believe but it itself won't lower them much if at all. The big part that will reduce fees (or help reduce further, see below in good news) is sharding; which is planned after the merge.
&gt; 
&gt; **Good news**: The technology that will reduce fees will be here (and or are **already here**) BEFORE the merge. Layer 2s specifically rollups (optimistic types and ZK types) are here today. [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) and [Arbitrum](https://offchainlabs.com/) are optimistic rollups that you can use today that have a [fraction of the fees as mainnet ETH](https://l2fees.info/). In terms of ZK rollups, some are out today for exchange, payment and NFT use ([dydX](https://dydx.exchange/), [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/) and [ImmutableX](https://www.immutable.com/) are some of them); but the universal use ones are [entering alpha soon at by November](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-alpha-is-coming-to-mainnet-b825829eaf32). The sharding mentioned above will provide data to these data-hungry rollups to further increase efficiency and throughput.
&gt; 
&gt; ZK rollups are expected to be even crazier than optimistic rollups in terms of fee costs and efficiency. [Here is the block explorer of UniSync](https://zksync2-alpha.zkscan.io/), a Uniswap V2 port on zkSync (which uses zk rollup tech). Click any block and check out the fees.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes I acknowledge at this point in time there's a tedious amount of steps that need to be taken to geton these Layer 2s (Spending mainnet gas to bridge to them etc); good news is exchanges like coinbase are working on a direct 'on-ramp' straight onto these networks so soon you'll be able to go straight from FIAT -&gt; a Layer 2 directly, skipping the mainnet -&gt; bridging process entirely. 
&gt; 
&gt; This should 'dumb' things down a bit and have a tad more of a seamless UX; the end goal is having the user buy ETH with fiat and start transacting on 'Ethereum' without realizing they're on a rollup at all",1635624846,hiomlfl

"""Another new solution is a project being done by the Ethereum Foundation. In fact, Loopring is also participating in this project, which is just called “zkEVM”.
Its idea is to directly compile the Solidity code into the byte code of the EVM without any translation, and directly execute the byte code in the virtual environment of zkEVM. Its virtual environment does the two biggest things. The first is to prove that the execution of byte code is correct, called EVM proof; the second is to prove that the modification of the world state is correct.
I think this solution may be the final Layer-2 network.

Of course, LRC is not really related to the Gamestop collab, but assuming Loopring’s brand increases in perceived value because of this news, LRC should also take off, as it’s currently the only way to throw money at Loopring.  
  
In my opinion, Loopring’s value is going to get a huge pump that it won’t come down from, so I see LRC as something to throw at least $100 in. And judging from its ATH, I’m shooting for $500 to ride the hopefully 4x gains to a cool 2 grand.",1635745885,hiusmhh

 The money from shib and this weird Meme altcoin season won't last long - I think it's going to last until the discovery period is over for the xrp/sec thing in December - then depending on the outcome 

(xrp wins, is declared a currency) will kick off remittance coin season - xrp to 3-6$+ and xlm will drag behind but lanchpad is wide open for them

 (xrp loses, is an unregistered security) xrp exchange in the US is put on hold and xrp keeps going on in the world... Dumps to ~0.30 - XLM jumps to new all time highs over 60 cents as the clear winner in remittance Battle - amp soars because Bitcoin lightning network usage goes up

"It's hard to find bearish arguments because when bearish sentiment is posted, it's immediately buried beneath positive sentiment from the people who hold the coin, who generally come in to ""protect their investment"" from ""fud"".

When the Nano network was physically down for over a month, unable to process payments of any kind unless you *manually pushed PoW through*, there were very few posts about it. In the few that were up, I would mention that I had a Kraken deposit delayed for over 3 weeks straight, and a friend who was trying to use the network almost gave up $300 because he had sent it almost a month earlier and it was still stuck.

The responses? 

- I was told that *""Even in this state, the Nano Network works better than Bitcoin"".* (Word for word)
- I was told that *""This kind of thing is great for the network, it's still operating under a heavy spam attack.""*
- I was told that *""This kind of thing has happened to every big coin, bullish for Nano""*.

No one likes talking about the negative aspects of ""their coin"" because that means they might possibly lose money.

Another recent trend of this is Loopring. The coin has been around for 4 years - But mentioning that zkRollups is not new technology and that it's been discussed for years around here is met with STAUNCH defensiveness from the new holders.

I've been told that I am ""bashing"" the coin for pointing out basic information. ""Fudding"".  'Hating' on the coin.

The people who've entered the space (especially recently) are fervently defensive of their investment in a way they'd literally never defend a stock, or precious metals, or any other thing they own. They literally can't talk about the negatives, or even perceived negatives, because that would somehow destroy their POV that the coin is the best thing since sliced bread.

Coin specific subreddits don't make this any better. They're even more of an echo chamber than here is.",1637342443,hl9zquw

"Understanding the hype behind Loopring.

Facts: 


1. Listed as a coin to watch on Grayscale (Canadian retirement fund with $40bn AUM) the previous coin to get accepted 2x'd in the same month. Source: Founder on twitter posting screenshot of document from Grayscale



2. Fee-less wallet will launch this week on the L2. So setting up a wallet which currently costs 150usd will become 0. Source: their Dev's on discord. Update: New changes on GitHub reflect this already! 



3. Staking is also be available via their official wallet 



4. Bank of China Patent includes use of LRC as you may be aware of it. 



5. Q4 2021 announcement nearing everyday 



6. GitHub code shows GameStop services mentioned twice. One time regarding export of NFT and later on in the second leak showed their beta testing url (staging server) whose SSL certificate ownership lies with GameStop.


7. 10% burn on transaction fees 



8. Exchanges if they want to use loopring need to hold 250k LRC on-chain or 1m LRC off-chain - which means every new exchange on this will reduce the supply of coins on the market.


9. The new wallet supports Fiat ramp-on and Fiat ramp-off 


10. Being Layer 2 and having ZK-Rollup allows it to process 4000 transactions per second. Once Eth 2.0 goes live, this will scale up as well. 

11. Loopring is also an AMM 

Opinion:



1. GME announcement about their NFT market place will be a huge doubling event for the coin 



2. Relatively low market cap and wide wallet acceptance will sky rocket the price


3. Personally, I feel we are looking at a $10 coin in the next 2-3 months by January. 


4. D. Wang said that the announcement will be worth 10 Quarterly reports 

Price per coin against Marker Cap - Source: Coin Perspective:

1. If Loopring enters the top 10 and gets to the 34.7bn Market Cap that's required for it, it's price per coin would be $27.84

2. If Loopring overtakes Doge's market cap of 36.3bn at number 9, it's price per coin would be $29.13

3. If Loooring overtakes DOT's market cap of 53.4bn at number 8, it's price per coin would be $42.84

4. At top 20, if Loopring overtakes MATIC's market cap of 12.6bn, it's price per coin would be $10.08",1637340600,hl9v0gz

The problem is GameStop has said nothing about this, everyone is just assuming. GameStop could cancel the entire thing or they are only doing research with LRC and even if they do do whatever people think they are doing with it (NFTs) doesn't mean it will work or be a success.

However this uncertainty hasn't stopped everyone from piling in on it and posting, ""To the moon!"" and ""Let's go!"".

It's super sad how desperate people are to get rich quick. That's all there is behind the current LRC hype. No one knows how it will be used.

think there are many incentives provided for app developers by the teams working on layer 2s, i guess the most active community with users wins. 

so they might migrate to a chain where fees are better for users for example. i dont know of any examples",1635474607,higpqt7

* Understand and lead integrations with different blockchains and Ethereum Layer 2 environments

im just gonna link this explanation about layer 2s because i don't think i can say it better with bolded points related to why the company might choose a layer 2 until ETH becomes cheaper and can handle more txs

[https://www.benzinga.com/money/what-is-layer-2-on-ethereum/](https://www.benzinga.com/money/what-is-layer-2-on-ethereum/)

&gt;Layer 1 vs Layer 2 on EthereumLayer 1 is the term used for the underlying blockchain architecture and changes to it are called Layer 1 solutions. For example, Ethereum could be scaled easily by increasing the block size and therefore the number of transactions verified per block. However, this would make mining prohibitively expensive – centralizing the network to only the richest miners with the best equipment. This could leave the power of verifying the chain in the hands of few, endangering the network to malicious attacks. The Ethereum community doesn’t want to make this Layer 1 change because it would sacrifice decentralization and thus network security.**Layer 2 solutions build on top of the network and require no changes to the Layer 1**. Layer 2 solutions still leverage the security of the consensus mechanism of the Layer 1 network, but they can **drastically speed up transactions**. Ethereum’s Layer 1 can handle about 15 transactions per second, while some Layer 2 projects can ramp it up to 4,000 transactions per second. Scalability upgrades to the Layer 1 Ethereum network are slated for the upcoming years, and Layer 2 will prevent dApps from leaving Ethereum in the short term.

tldr; layer 2s can be faster and handle more volume while using the security of the 1st layer

and i mean it's not confirmed, as in people have only speculated gamestop would choose loopring. as far as i am aware they have never publicly announced which sidechain they will use for their nfts

"Loopring is focused on zero knowledge proof rollups.  It is a kind of layer 2 which retains the security properties (decentralization) of base layer while also increasing tps and reducing transaction prices.  

Early layer 2s like polygon sacrifice some security (centralize themselves) to be faster and cheaper.  Optimistic rollups like arbitrum are kind of the easier to execute but not quite as good as zero knowledge rollups.... they have better security properties than side chains (polygon).

The technical details of why these things are true is unclear to me... vb has stated he expects that sidechains will be important for a bit, replaced by optimistic rollups, and then zero knowledge rollups eventually win after all kinks worked out.",1635471409,higit72

Posts by Loopring on LinkedIn reveal that GameStop’s soon-to-be-announced NFT marketplace will feature instant, gas-free transactions.

Last night, GMEdd published source code from Loopring’s public GitHub repository that confirmed the highly-speculated partnership amongst the ambitious pioneers.

Prior to this, GMEdd.com had published digital breadcrumbs leading to that same point, detailing how Loopring has the technology that GameStop would require to bridge traditional e-commerce and blockchain and engineer the revolution of gaming.

You know the drill. Read those posts first, then come back. Actually, you’ve probably read them already, considering GMEdd.com crashed amid all the traffic and LRC went up 58.5% today. You’re welcome, Loopring. Sorry if we startled you.

NOBODY RIDES FOR FREE

In an October 13th, 2021 thread on Twitter, Damiana Amabile, a former Chewy executive turned GameStop Director of Product shared her frustration with completing her first purchase on leading NFT marketplace OpenSea. 

Amabile states that, “the process was not easy,” and that it was eye-opening considering how traditional e-commerce has embraced a one-click/tap checkout experience.

The first tweet in Amabile’s Twitter thread discusses gas fees.

The GameStop Director of Product’s first complaint about OpenSea was that the concept of “gas fees” is so foreign to anyone not in the space. She imagines this is a high drop off point in the conversion tunnel. 
“Gas fees” are the transaction fees that users pay on a blockchain protocol to have their transaction executed. The system works on a standard supply and demand mechanism. 

If there is more demand for transactions, users will be forced to pay more to have their transactions processed quickly and efficiently. Currently, there’s plenty of demand.

High gas fees can be regarded as one of Ethereum’s biggest inhibitors to growth, with little desire for users to complete trades that often cost more than what they’re worth.

High gas fees have plagued Ethereum for over a year.
In a CoinDesk Opinion story from October 14, 2020, former Amazon executive turned CEO of a blockchain education company Michael J. Garbade writes that High Ethereum gas prices make it impossible for ERC-20 projects to run any microtransaction payments on Ethereum, defeating the idea of using the Ethereum network for one of its principal use cases.
Garbade explores one potential solution: zkRollup technology, stating that the trustless protocol from zkSync was, at the time, the most efficient answer.

zkRollup technology has the potential to solve high gas fees on Ethereum’s network
While there are several companies that have built ETH Layer 2 protocols using zkRollup technology, Loopring has since emerged as one of the most advanced and capable of mass-adoption.

LOOPRING, WE’RE NOT DONE YET

Loopring states that one major advantage of being application specific is that the protocol can optimize Loopring’s L1 footprint to the extreme as opposed to other Layer 2s. 

This means Loopring L2 is much more scalable, faster + less expensive to use than other general purpose Ethereum L2s.

If you’re confused, Loopring’s Head of Community Byron Wiebe can frequently be found answering questions from LRC holders and curious GameStop investors alike on Loopring’s Discord server (to the best of his ability given the circumstances).

Byron answered some questions from ManBearOrca on October 26th.

When asked about delaying the launch until ETH2.0 is live, Byron goes on to state that Loopring’s technology is already capable of handling 4,000 transactions per second currently, “similar capacity to Mastercard daily transactions globally.”

Byron also states that Loopring’s free Layer2 Wallet will be launching simultaneously or prior to the NFT Marketplace, allowing for easy adoption amongst those who aren’t used to crypto.

“WE UH, WE FIXED THE GLITCH.”

In a LinkedIn post today, Loopring has added some commentary on their Q3 2021 Quarterly Update, which was published by Byron.
Loopring announced that they will be enabling NFT support, “allowing anyone to mint and trade NFTs instantly and gas-free.”


Loopring shared this post on LinkedIn on October 28th 2021.

Loopring goes on to state that this functionality is now the foundation of a new NFT Marketplace launching soon.

With Damiana Amabile’s major gripes with NFT transactions solved by Loopring, the gap between traditional e-commerce and blockchain could be bridged.
It’s now beyond a reasonable doubt that GameStop has found a partner for their venture into the future.

Just transferred $6000 from my money market to my checking, this is gonna be play money. I bought $900 of loopring today and $1200 of SHIB a few days ago. I’ll still be ETH and BTC heavy, but I know I’ve got more gamble in me than this… I don’t wanna be middle class forever.",1635520756,hiit9pj

Btc - Obvious why. Lent out using a lending platform so I earn interest.

Eth - Again obvious. Staked for 2.0 so I earn interest.

Bnb - Gotta have a cex coin, huge userbase and massive utility. Another obvious pick in my eyes. Staked to earn interest.

Dot - Interoperability is the future and I think Dot becomes the leader here quite comfortably. Staked some and the rest locked up in parachains: Acala, Moonbeam, Astar and Litentry so far, but I have plans for others.

Did have Matic but sold recently at 15x.

I've spent hours and hours looking for interesting projects but honestly I can't find any. I have looked at loads of L1 blockchains - not really interested in the sovereignity issues combined with bridges/security issues. I've looked at L2's like Matic which were great this bullrun but no guarantee Eth 2.0 doesn't make them obsolete.

Metaverse currently doesn't interest me but I do own a few rare nft's.

I am more a long term investor so chasing market themes and quick pumps etc aint my thing. Hence I've kept away from loopring, shib etc.

- even if we just look at protocol, it only includes centralised repos from IOHK, Ethereum foundation, Gnosis etc. this cherry picks the centralised Cardano development model where all changes go through a CEO (CH) and a single team (IOHK).

Understanding the hype behind Loopring.

Facts: 


1. Listed as a coin to watch on Grayscale (Canadian retirement fund with $40bn AUM) the previous coin to get accepted 2x'd in the same month. Source: Founder on twitter posting screenshot of document from Grayscale



2. Fee-less wallet will launch this week on the L2. So setting up a wallet which currently costs 150usd will become 0. Source: their Dev's on discord. Update: New changes on GitHub reflect this already! Update: Dev's discord said the delay is because of the third party payments provider for Fiat On-Ramp. Rest is ready. 



3. Staking is also be available via their official wallet 



4. Bank of China Patent includes use of LRC as you may be aware of it. 



5. Q4 2021 announcement nearing everyday 



6. GitHub code shows GameStop services mentioned twice. One time regarding export of NFT and later on in the second leak showed their beta testing url (staging server) whose SSL certificate ownership lies with GameStop.


7. 10% burn on transaction fees 



8. Exchanges if they want to use loopring need to hold 250k LRC on-chain or 1m LRC off-chain - which means every new exchange on this will reduce the supply of coins on the market.


9. The new wallet supports Fiat ramp-on and Fiat ramp-off. Update: To be launched in Q3 2022 as per official discord. HUGE UPDATE: THE NEW WALLET WILL LAUNCH WITH FIAT RAMP-ON 


10. Being Layer 2 and having ZK-Rollup allows it to process 4000 transactions per second. Once Eth 2.0 goes live, this will scale up as well. 

11. Loopring is also an AMM 

Opinion:



1. GME announcement about their NFT market place will be a huge doubling event for the coin 



2. Relatively low market cap and wide wallet acceptance will sky rocket the price


3. Personally, I feel we are looking at a $10 coin in the next 2 months by end of January. 


4. D. Wang said that the announcement will be worth 10 Quarterly reports 

5. Personally I feel we'll jump to $4.5usd on Wallet announcement and $6.5usd on partnership announcement regardless of the partner. If it is GME maybe $7.5? 


Price per coin against Marker Cap - Source: Coin Perspective:

1. If Loopring enters the top 10 and gets to the 34.7bn Market Cap that's required for it, it's price per coin would be $27.84

2. If Loopring overtakes Doge's market cap of 36.3bn at number 9, it's price per coin would be $29.13

3. If Loooring overtakes DOT's market cap of 53.4bn at number 8, it's price per coin would be $42.84

4. At top 20, if Loopring overtakes MATIC's market cap of 12.6bn, it's price per coin would be $10.08",1637820380,hm05g87

Right now I cant buy it on any major exchanges I. The US, I could buy it on SushiSwap but then I’d have to pay crazy gas fees because SushiSwap does most of its work on the Ethereum network which is expensive.

"It gets a bit technical, but there's actually a pretty big difference.

Loopring is a rollup, which is an L2 scaling solution that inherits the security properties of Ethereum. This means that the Loopring team can't steal your funds and if Loopring stops operating their rollup, users with funds stuck on Loopring can always retrieve them back to Ethereum. This is why rollups are a big deal and the only safe way blockchains will scale in the near future.

Polygon is a sidechain, which is its own blockchain running a copy of Ethereum, but with their own delegated proof of stake consensus mechanism. This means it's nowhere near as secure as Ethereum, and if Polygon for some reason stops operating, the the funds are lost. Polygon will eventually launch their own zk rollup like Loopring.

Avalanche I've never paid much attention to, but as far as I know it's also an Ethereum copy that has replaced PoW with delegated Proof of Stake. So it's its own separate network which operates like Ethereum, but isn't as secure as Ethereum.",1636461209,hjxfnrm

**Biggest Changes:**

-	**WE HAVE SET A NEW RECORD FOLKS!** Never has a single coin ever hit the 4000+ mentions marker. Even when BTC and ETH hit their ATHs, even when there was DOGE mania on this sub and even when we were going through a monster bull run earlier this year. No coin ever got 4000+ mentions. Until today. LRC has just set the record for the most mentions of a coin in a single day.
-	The rest of the Top 5 broadly remains the same as yesterday, but DOT has reentered the chart following a 36% increase in mentions over the past day, replacing VET in the chart which has now slipped to 11th place.
-	Special mentions also go out to LTO (10th place) and XLM (13th place), which have both seen 120%+ increases in mentions over the past day.

"Loopring. 

Etherium as a network has a maximum amount of transactions it can handle per seconds (what people call the TPS). Gas fees values are related to the ratio of supply and demand for transactions. When the amount of transactions requested by users approach or goes above this limit, the gas fees increase. This is automatically done to incentivise users to delay their transaction until the network is less congested and gas fees would be lower again.

The LRC is called a layer 2 protocol. When you request a transaction on LRC network, it will get bundled up with plenty of others, then sent to the main Etherium network for confirmation as a single package. This means ETH network only sees the bundle as a single transaction. 

This has a double effect on gas fees :

First, while I don't know the actual ratio, let's assume LRC bundles 40 transaction into 1 packet sent to ETH network, this means that if you are part of this bundle, you will share the ETH gas fees with 39 other people, so you would pay 40 times less. This is the immediate effect that you will see as user of LRC chain.

The second effect is a derivative of the above. If 40 people use the LRC to make a transaction bundle, ETH only sees a single transaction, this will cause a drop in the demand for transactions on the main ETH network, which will cause the ETH gas fees to go down for everybody.",1636548212,hk27wvg

"&gt;The only “tokenomics” behind LRC is the hat L2 exchanges must hold x amount to create the exchange. Asides from that, LRC does nothing for loopring protocol. As you said, the L2 protocol requires eth for user interaction.

This is not true. [Whitepapter](https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf). Checko out 8.1 Fee Model.

&gt;When a user creates an order, they specify an amount of
LRx to be paid to the ring-miner as a fee, in conjunction
with a percentage of the margin (marginSplitPercentage)
made on the order that the ring-miner can claim. This is
called the margin split. The decision of which one to choose
(fee or margin split) is left to the ring-miner.

&gt;It should be noted that if the LRx fee is non-zero,
no matter which option the ring-miner chooses, there will
always be a transfer of LRx between the ring-miner and the
order’s sender. Either the ring-miner earns the LRx fee, or
pays the LRx fee back to the sender to take the margin split.

LRx is used as a tip to ring-miners.",1636543851,hk21632

"Miners have absolutely nothing to do with fees. They don't even collect them all (most are burned, since EIP1559). Even once the switch to proof of stake where there are zero miners the fees will remain the same.

The reason fees are high is because the block size is small. Every block is full so to get your transaction processed you're bidding against other people for that block space. The reason they don't increase the block size is because it would require more specialized or expensive hardware thereby centralizing it (SOL is an extreme case where essentially only banks can afford to run nodes).

Using a layer 2 built on Ethereum your transaction gets batched with 1000 other transactions so each person only pays 1/1000 the fee for posting their data on Ethereum. The more congested a L2 becomes the more people you're splitting this fee with so the cheaper it becomes. You can opt into using a layer 2 now which I always recommend everyone do. If OP used Arbitirium to do their Uniswap and it still timed out they would have only lost $1 in fees instead. The reason they have to pay fees at all is because some blocks space was used up, and without any fee people could use their refund to spam and congest the network. 

Layer 2's like Loopring (which uses Zkrollups) will be what Ethereum uses to further scale into Sharding, where they break the main chain into 64 chains with 4 dedicated to computing like minting NFTs. This should drastically reduce fees across the whole ecosystem but full sharding won't come for some years.",1636541677,hk1ybe1

 I'm also lucky that I have friends and family who made the mistakes and imparted some good knowledge I shouldn't know at this early stage. Even at that I managed to get tokens trapped on metamask due to insane gas fees.

I will say, you might be a bit late as the market will likely slow down and contract in early Jan. At that stage I will be sitting on a stable coin until I feel confident that things are at their cheapest to load up again.

I guess I just don't understand the benefits. When they say to use ETH you should use LRC, but then I'm not using ETH, so it defeats the purpose of being on Ethereum?

"If you're using an L2 like Arbitrum, Optimism or Loopring, then you're still using Ethereum, just indirectly through the L2.",1636270595,hjnf7pw
"Eth2 is a multi-phase upgrade that is designed to make the base network layer (the L1 network) more efficient, more secure and more scalable, but due to its multi-phase nature, it will do so in a number of incremental updates, rather than all at once.

Phase 0, which is the phase we're in now, is the launch of the beacon chain (the backbone of the Eth2 L1 network) and the PoS consensus mechanism that is securing the beacon chain (we're at this point now, the beacon chain is live and secured by PoS as we speak), ending with the current PoW L1 chain being connected to the beacon chain, becoming the first shard (the ""main"" shard, is what it's called) of the network (this is the merge, and is what we're waiting for).

Phase 1, which will be the next phase occurring after the merge, is the launch of data shards, where 63 new secondary blockchains will be launched and connected to the beacon chain, acting as additional data storage for the main shard to use. These new shards *cannot* execute transactions themselves, they're *solely* used for data storage, with execution being left to the main shard.

Phase 2, which will occur sometime after phase 1, is an upgrade that brings execution capabilities to some or all of the 63 additional shards, allowing them to independently execute their own transactions in parallel with each other. At this point, the main shard terminology will likely be phased out, becoming just another shard available to the Eth2 L1 network.

There are additional upgrades between each phase, and additional phases happening after these phases, but these phases are the main three that are part of the Eth2 roadmap right now.

Phase 0 will not affect gas prices much, if at all, as the only thing changing is the consensus mechanism (moving to PoS) and the consensus layer (consensus will now be handled by the beacon chain, rather than the current PoW chain). Block times remain largely the same (12 seconds under Eth2 vs 13-14 seconds right now), block sizes remain exactly the same, all that's changed is how the network is secured.

Phase 1 may affect gas prices on the L1, depending on how much on-chain data storage is the bottleneck (ie if on-chain computation is the bottleneck, phase 1 won't affect L1 gas prices), but it will affect gas prices within L2 rollups, as rollups can make use of the extra data storage to store more L2 transactions on chain at once.

Phase 2, if it comes, will affect gas prices on the L1, as on-chain computation will occur simultaneously across all shards, and it may also affect gas prices within L2s, depending on if L2s can make use of the additional computational headroom that phase 2 offers. Phase 2 may not happen as planned, or at all, though, as computation isn't an easy thing to shard. We may end up getting through phase 1 and calling it good enough, as L2s should bring our TPS up into the tens of thousands of TPS, if not hundreds of thousands of TPS, without sharded computation.

Either way, what *will* affect gas prices is the continued use of Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, zkSync, ZKSwap, StarkNet (once it opens up in their alpha phase), etc. L2 solutions can increase TPS be moving execution off chain and posted transaction data on chain in a compressed form to more efficiently using limited block space, basically posting 100+ L2 transactions on chain with just a single L1 transaction, dividing the gas costs between all 100+ L2 participants.",1636270400,hjnf00y

 I think in this case the gamestop rumour has clearly been the driving force in creating so much publicity for LRC, as they have done very little marketing, and now that it is in the public eye, people are realising that its actually a really solid project that could do very well even without the partnership

Gamestop was a dying, outdated business that got revived by reddit hype and Loopring might become a major player in the crypto space. 

And also yeah, GMEs mcap is likely to rise alongside LRCs if the rumours are true, so even if it does reach 30b, it likely wont be double of that gamestops by the time it gets there.",1636868815,hkjyvm6

Facts: 


1. Listed as a coin to watch on Grayscale (Canadian retirement fund with $40bn AUM) the previous coin to get accepted 2x'd in the same month. Source: Founder on twitter posting screenshot of document from Greyscale



2. Fee-less wallet will launch this week on the L2. So setting up a wallet which currently costs 150usd will become 0. Source: their Dev's on discord. Update: New changes on GitHub reflect this already! Update 2: L2 wallet a little delayed as per their discord, they want to get it working perfectly as it'll be handling a lot of transactions. Update 3: New function added to their GitHub related to the wallet on 13th November.  



3. Staking will also be available via their official wallet 



4. Bank of China Patent includes use of LRC as you may be aware of it. 



5. Q4 2021 announcement nearing everyday 



6. GitHub code shows GameStop services mentioned twice. One time regarding export of NFT and later on in the second leak showed their beta testing url (staging server) whose SSL certificate ownership lies with GameStop.


7. 10% burn on transaction fees 



8. Exchanges if they want to use loopring need to hold 250k LRC on-chain or 1m LRC off-chain - which means every new exchange on this will reduce the supply of coins on the market.


9. The new wallet supports Fiat ramp-on and Fiat ramp-off 


10. Being Layer 2 and having ZK-Rollup allows it to process 4000 transactions per second. Once Eth 2.0 goes live, this will scale up as well. 


Opinion:



1. GME announcement about their NFT market place will be a huge 10x event for the coin 



2. Relatively low market cap and wide wallet acceptance will sky rocket the price


3. Personally, I feel we are looking at a $10 coin in the next 2-3 months by January. 

4. The coin has still not hit mainstream youtubers. I feel it'll go ballistic when it does! 

Price per coin against Marker Cap - Source: Coin Perspective:

1. If Loopring enters the top 10 and gets to the 34.7bn Market Cap that's required for it, it's price per coin would be $27.84

2. If Loopring overtakes Doge's market cap of 36.3bn at number 9, it's price per coin would be $29.13

3. If Loooring overtakes DOT's market cap of 53.4bn at number 8, it's price per coin would be $42.84

I'm very new to crypto, I joined up with coinbase as a bored whim, was told I needed to transfer some money to my account to activate it, so I did, only a very small amount of money. This was last week. I bought Loopring because I liked the name (I am 100% in agreement with how stupid this was, and will be doing legit research from now on). 

It turns out that random buy was a good idea and now my tiny amount of money is still small, but less so. My question is, how do you guys know when to sell? And do you sell into $ or trade to another coin?",1636353935,hjrz7zz

"It's just not as straightforward as some people try to sell it, that's all. Most of the issues aren't very apparent until you actually try them out. For one, the gas fees aren't completely gone, so depending what you're trying to do, it might still not be worth it for small transactions. For two, composability is a pretty big issue. I mean, I don't think Coinbase even has a Layer 2 withdrawal service yet still. A lot of Layer 2s aren't as open as base-layer Ethereum was, meaning you can't just have anyone create a smart contract on them, there aren't third party block explorers or wallets. That stuff is underrated. Third issue is there's a big gas cost to sign up with some Layer 2s, like Loopring. 

The best parts about crypto happen when a lot of different teams with lots of different visions come together and are each able to build tools to share with each other. That's the Ethereum Money Legos meme, essentially, right? Feel like this gets lost with a lot of Layer 2s. Maybe things will change though.",1636353058,hjry1ml
"Honestly, I think loopring will do fine, but they're late.  Arbitrum does \*exactly\* what they do but they have a vibrant defi ecosystem with Uniswap, Sushiswap, Curve, Abracadabra and a ton of established players. Optimism does almost the same thing.  Polygon runs the matic sidechain, but people forget that they also run a plasma chain and are soon to release their own roll-ups. Speaking of sidechains, there are a ton and their security is good enough for me.  Fantom, Matic, Avax are killing it, bsc is kinda gross but whatever, even xdai and harmony one (sharding!) are fun little chains with more going on than I was able to find on lrc.

"Matic is a monolithic L2 as a “side car” POS chain for eth. Loopring is a modular L2 that’s built “on top” of eth. Matic can have rollup tech, but it’s fundamentally capped in ways Loopring is not. 

This the architecture is different and a fundamental assumption of crypto is speed = lower cost.

Imagine you need to travel from LA to NYC. Now imagine Eth is a super car. Not a bad way to travel from LA to NYC. Let’s upgrade the car though, and add a turbo. Matic is that turbo charger added into the car. Eventually the gains provided by the turbo cap and you need a bigger turbo/gas/upgrades to go faster. 

Loopring is like airplane and for us to go faster from LA to NYC we just put the super car in the back of the plane and ship it.

I simp for loopring,1636338157,hjr82g0
Can't decide between my cockring and loopring tonight guess i gotta surprise my wife with whatever works better,1636338156,hjr82cy
Loopring IS my girlfriend.,1636338061,hjr7v61
What's with the 2 huge spikes in Loopring today followed by the immediate corrections? If it was the reverse I'd guess it was whales hunting for stop-sells to pick some up but dun understand what the reverse of that indicates... any idea? Is it just the price rallying and hitting stop-sells that people have to cash out?,1636337997,hjr7q95
Loopring to $30. It could happen. The doge and Shiba runs have proven it can,1636337748,hjr76wd
Yay bought $1k Loopring with my DOT profits !!!,1636337532,hjr6qlm
Hopefully my coin transfers in enough time so I can buy more loopring.,1636337436,hjr6j0t
"I have seriously had a recurring deja Vu dream about loopring. There have been times I wanted to sell but then think about this dre and was like...I'll hold on to it... something special is about to unfold. It's wuwu, but I believe and this lrc movement has been a bit of a revelation for me.",1636337314,hjr699x
"selling or trading loopring at .30-70 sense, selling mana at $1 and feeling like a genius after buying at .30 too 

i’m not a genius obviously",1638545999,hn2tclw

"Seeing Loopring as one of today’s top movers: 😄
Realising it’s because of how much it has decreased by: 🥺",1638544775,hn2qezi
"I would call that the ""whack-a-mole"" strategy. The coin you're holding isn't doing anything so you sell it for the next big thing. Then the next big thing consolidates and the coin you sold starts pumping. Lol. We've all been there. 

But in the long term, you didn't lose out on much. I see matic doing a 2-3x in 2022 while I see Loopring doing a 7-10x in 2022 due to its relatively smaller market cap. IMO FTM, Cosmos, algorand, Hbar, kadena, chiliz, cartesi, harmony, ergo, radix, tezos, and other similar defi blockchains and protocols can do 5x or more in 2022. I would just buy all of them instead of guessing which horse is going to win the defi race. Nobody is smart enough to do it.",1638543934,hn2ofdf
I guess Matic Arbitrum and Loopring are already doing a good job on this.,1638542771,hn2lr50
"Ethereum is Layer1 and there are several different teams working on different Layer2 rollups.

They are sort of chains running on top of Ethereum. 

Some will have their own coin but they always use ETH to pay for the Ethereum security backing them.

Avaliable today : Arbitrum and Optimistic, starknet just launched their alpha and has very few dapps.

Coming soon : zk sync 2.0

Further into the future : loopring (General purpose), polygon midas",1638542083,hn2k79h
I sold Loopring at $3 to buy MATIC.,1638541802,hn2jl3y
Certainly glad I sold my MATIC to buy the Loopring top. I'm an actual clown.,1638541286,hn2igf9
"Crypto.com going after the everyman.  
  
Algorand going after chess grand masters. 
  
Loopring going after gamers",1638540168,hn2g3w7
I like to live dangerously.  Actually this is my thought with loopring everyday because they have been taking over by G M E and SS.,1638536250,hn28rvx
GameStop last minute choosing Matic instead of Loopring as Layer2,1638536151,hn28lsc
I've heard a Loopring might make it stay up.,1638535896,hn2865l
He meant Loopring (LRC) and the rumours are that the NFT marketplace that they're going to announce in Q4 2021 (before 31st December that is) is going to be GME's marketplace,1638534512,hn25z4i
Im 75% Loopring 25% ImmutableX so… you’re good?! 🤣,1638534502,hn25yk8
Who else is in on this amazing loopring dip?! I'm filling my bags.,1638532784,hn23ffq
"Loopring already pumped. The real holders who’ve had the coin since 30 cents are up 800%. 

It’s just the fomo idiots who bought at 3.50 that are stuck holding losing bags. They’re paying the real holders.",1638532605,hn236eo
My loopring is the only coin I have that more than doubled in value. I am glad I listened to shills here and bought it early.,1638531912,hn227qh
Cro and Loopring,1638531295,hn21e6m
"Great idea, but we don't have or need spankdollars for this dollars work well, so if you can tip on Twitter using Lightning BTC, I don't see why the porn industry can't get with the program. I mean it works for McDonalds and Starbucks in El Salvador, it should work everywhere.

  


I can imagine rewards programs giving out NFTs as tickets for private videos, kind of like promo codes, and they could be used on different sites. They should use Loopring NFTs when those become available.

  


And I can see 3D models in lingerie, or small clips with seasonal clothes being offered as a porn sticker collection, porn calendar or porn playing cards. Again sell the NFT on the porn site, use it in Heartstone or Lichess as skin.

  


I don't see the adult industry making future proof decisions on this, but they're plenty of players and some will probably come on top using the new tech, has happened time and time again.",1638530759,hn20p53
Just before Loopring had it's first major pump I said to my wife I should grow some balls and go all in on LRC. That day I converted 3 times like 7% into it but didn't dare to convert rest. Well it's hindsight but I was really close to going all in. IDCA'ed another 30% of my portfolio into it while it was pumping but damn that would have been an insane move. Now my wife teases me sometimes about growing some balls.,1638530283,hn202wx
"I want to sell all my loopring for CRO but both are tanking rn. The longer the LRC ""announcement"" take the more convinced I am that it was all shilled.",1638529248,hn1ys1z

It's an application-specific L2, purpose built as a dex with some other features tacked on, while there's already general-purpose L2s built on slightly inferior tech available right now that are capable of supporting any dapp, and there are general-purpose L2s being built on the same tech that Loopring is that will also be capable of supporting any dapp.

Loopring is also working on their own general-purpose L2, but the point is that they've got a **lot** of competition. It's not just Loopring, it's Loopring, dYdX, zkSync, ZKSwap, Arbitrum, Optimism, StarkEX, Polygon Hermez, etc.",1636587217,hk4uuwd

-	WE HAVE SET A NEW RECORD FOLKS! Never has a single coin ever hit the 4000+ mentions marker. Even when BTC and ETH hit their ATHs, even when there was DOGE mania on this sub, or even when we were going through a monster bull run earlier this year. No coin ever got 4000+ mentions. Until today. LRC has just set the record for the most mentions of a coin in a single day.
-	The rest of the Top 5 broadly remains the same as yesterday, with BTC moving up a place to 2nd and DOT also reentering the chart following a 36% increase in mentions over the past day, replacing VET in the chart which has now slipped to 11th place.
-	Special mentions also go out to LTO (10th place) and XLM (13th place), which have both seen 120%+ increases in mentions over the past day.

LRC started this month with a $750 million valuation, but by the 10th, a 540% rally had lifted its market cap to almost $5 billion.

My bet is on LoopRing (LRC). On top of Partnerships with GameStop (to build an NFT marketplace for gaming), and potentially Bank of China and Facebook, this is going to be used as a Gateway for ETH transactions. It’s going to cut the gas fees down to about 1/85th of what they are now. This is how big players like GameStop etc are to offer NFT trading for basically free. 

Once the gas fees of buying/selling NFTs can get down to a reasonable place, and GameStop releases an NFT marketplace where you can trade for pennies on the dollar, Mass NFT Adoption will happen.

"A Very Hot rumor I got is Loopring Chief Executive Officer Daniel Wang moving a large bloc of Loopring cryptocurrency, possibly part of his own personal holdings, from Layer 1 to Layer 2 . This was interpreted in another reddit poster that found the data as providing liquidity for the launch of a GameStop non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace using the Loopring protocol. 

GameStop posted eight NFT-related jobs on its career page in last October. 

Also transfer of the CEO's tokens to Layer 2, are verifiable. That move is visible on Etherscan, which provides a record of token transfers, and shows large recent shifts by the wallet ""danielwang.eth.""",1638122100,hmfaurx

I tend to agree. People seem to think in black and white. If crypto sticks around and is a big success, it will be the same as now only bigger, and the best coins will prevail while some will go away. That does not sound right to me. As in all tech (vhs/beta &gt; DVD&gt; streaming, Friendster &gt;MySpace &gt; Facebook etc) the future will look nothing like the present.",1638115377,hmeusz2
"Ironically, by expecting a long term (5 years plus) plan from blochchain developers, you are being quite shortsighted (IMO - no offence intended).

The reality is that, if technological improvement continues to progress at it's current rate (it is actually accelerating exponentially) then most/all of the top chains in use today will be ghost chains in 10 years.

What you might *hope* for, is a few of the best chains developing into the digital basis for parts of the world economy. e.g. Loopring protocol being the basis for a new global payment processing system to rival Visa/Mastercard. But there is very little point in making solid plans for something such a long time away in this sector.

The idea of deploying smart wallets directly on L2s is also very interesting. I am not tech-savvy enough to understand all the constraints around this, but I find it interesting.

As for the GME partnership, of course I would have love to get another answer to that. But the fact that he cannot comment tells me that in could very well be true. I am not saying it is true, just that it could be. For me, this is still very bullish.",1638111541,hmemhf6

"Yes it is a problem at the moment.  
But the ""market"" is aware of it.  
For example Loopring as a Layer 2 for ETH will give hugh benefits like low gas fees.  


The question is more:  
Whats the future? Hard-wallets like Ledger? Software wallets? Exchanges?  


We need to find a way to lower the ENTRY cost (not only talking about money).  
Nobody how is putting 100 € a month a should force to buy a Ledger or s.t. else .  
We are here for the ""small guy"" .  
So make exchanges more secure like kraken and lower the Entry by a good infrastructure and guides. Thats the way for mass adoption and the future of crypto.

Stick with coins which have usecases and you will also get some money out.

Bitcoin is the new gold - but why should gold (ok nowerdays more for tec) and bitcoin stay this high? Its only because of mass adoption and emotion.  


ETH will rise if they can handle the gas fee - here comes Loopring LRC (the 1st Altcoin you should invest) - but Loopring is only an ETH Token and not his own ""currency"" - so also invest some money in ETH. Loopring will need for different reasons other altcoins to support ETH one of them will be AMP (i guess - maybe another) - so also go for AMP  
This are coins with an actual usecase (you can buy things in Store, make NFT markets, decentral etc.) and they will survive bearmarket AND gain gain you some money.  


On the other hand you have things like monero which is digital money ""only"" - if you think thats the future go ahead. But everything which is bounded by a ""real"" currency will gain less % .  


And than there is virtual money like MANA and a lot more. These things will go big BUT not all of them, the gain is limited by the succes of the games/virtual worlds they belong.  
But keep them in mind and in your portfolio.  


Ofc there are more out there, but these are my best guesses and underrated coins:  
ETH (still, think will be bigger than BTC in a few years) , LRC, AMP

The condition here is that after the Gamestop marketplace is launched, and it works, customers will come. Once it has shown use and stability, good strategy for any business is to expand. If there is a need for some new technology or tweaks to existing ones, smartcontracts, lockout protocol, lending mechanisms etc. will be added. Bitcoin is the first mover of its kind. Nano is not even though Nano came before Polkadot, it was not expanded on and is dead in the water. (Sorry Nanoers, I love Nano but it is really just a relic today)
Ethereum was a copy of Bitcoin, but it changed to become something else that Bitcoin was not meant to do. So Eth is a first mover in its class.

Gamestop will be the first movers in their class, if they expand on the momentum. If not, something else will be the “core of the gaming industry”.

"The solution is rolling out, its layer2 rollups!

1.	Gas fees are high because usage is high.
2.	This is not easily solvable by other blockchains, due to the [blockchain trilemma](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html).
4.	This will not be solved by ‘’ETH 2.0”, ETH2 is [the change from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake](https://ethmerge.com/).
5.	This **will** be solved by Layer 2. Lots of people are working on solutions. (See below)


The end goal of Ethereum is for users to do almost all their transactions on Layer 2 solutions. You’’ll be able to buy some ETH on [Coinbase](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-protocol-team-advances-crypto-community-aa9b3748bac5), send it through Optimism or Arbitrum to something like [Hop](https://hop.exchange/) where you’ll be able to hop on to immutable to buy an NFT, which you’ll be able to move to another L2 where you can use it as collateral for a loan.

Examples of Layer 2 solutions are:

-	[Optimism](https://optimism.io/) - Already usable in alpha phase
-	[Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.one) - Live and flourishing
-	[dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/), Using [Starkware](https://starkware.co/) - One of the first, already usable perpetual trading platform.
-	[Immutable X](https://www.immutable.com/) - Already usable, NFT market (focus on games)

C) Elon tweets 'Loopring is the future'

Then it could easily claim a $30bn market cap in similar vein to DOGE/SHIB. With the current supply a $30bn market cap would put the price at \~$30 per LRC.

Dreaming a little here, but conceivably if it nailed the Meme injection + fundamental interest then it could easily push a market cap of $50bn.

"It's always good to talk about the fundamentals and technology.

Before you jump in and blindly buy LRC, please DYOR. There are larger users who will benefit from cost savings with Loopring, but there are major issues preventing widespread adoption.

Since there are enough posts discussing one-sidedly about the PROs of Loopring, let's also discuss the other side for balance.

Loopring is a ZK Rollup platform and exchange originally founded in China. ZK rollups are very computationally-intensive and require strong infrastructure to process. The same goes with running nodes. Loopring calls itself a DEX, but it's towards the centralized end of the spectrum. It's able to operate feeless because it runs similarly to a CEX on a backend, except that it stores its transactions in a public Merkle tree. For customers, it makes sense mainly if you send out often on the Ethereum network.

The biggest issue is that it costs massive ETH gas fees to move from Layer 1 to Layer 2. It also costs fees to move back to L2, though that's much, much cheaper because it's aggregated (which also means it could take a couple of hours depending on usage). It's about 60K gas units to move to Layer 2 because it requires using its smart contract. [We have users earlier this week reporting $300 gas fees to create the Layer 2 wallet](
https://np.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/qiser5/why_it_is_so_expensive_to_move_eth_from_loopring/). Every time you want to move more funds to Layer 2, you will need to pay additional gas fees, so if you want to use it efficiently, you'll need to onboard as rarely as possible by whaling into the platform. Someone else mentioned counterfactual wallets yesterday, but that's just try-before-you-buy and doesn't address this issue at all.

Given those fees, I'm not sure how Gamestop can use this since I doubt its customers are going to want to pay a $100-300+ onboarding fee. I suppose Loopring could just turn into a full CEX and introduce Layer 2 fiat onramps, but that kind of defeats the purpose. Other larger CEXs could introduce their own ZK Rollup solutions and beat them at their own game.

While you can always recover your funds on Layer 1, it's also very expensive and impractical for smaller users. Someone did a test earlier this year and calculated that it takes about [1.3 million gas](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/withdraw-from-loopring-3-1-the-first-ever-experiment-of-shutting-down-a-zkrollup-24e6f333ca57) (more or less depending on the token) to perform Merkle tree withdrawal, which is currently over $1000.",1635952504,hj5o57o

"I've been following Loopring for over a year at least, I traded on the Beta 1 DEX back then and it was a very smooth and fast experience so it is great to see it get some recognition, especially with how high gas fees are these days. It did suffer from the problem of: No one used it because it had low liquidity, but it had low liquidity because no one used it.

I am a bit surprised to see a lot of people buying the LRC token though, I hope you all understand what it is actually used for before you purchase. If not, this is a great explanation. https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/lrc-tokenomics-v2-1e6fd99e9e9c",1635940648,hj4y9x6

"Glad /r/CryptoCurrency is finally catching up.

But if you think this is about LRC, you are missing the forest for the trees. Loopring is one of the multiple L2 scalability solutions that exist over Ethereum. It's getting a lot of attention now (well-deserved too) because there are strong hints that it has been chosen by GME. But it's in no way the clear winner and other L2 solutions are also very technically capable, it´s unlikely there is a winner takes all in the L2 space. Specially when bridges between them are mature.

What this is a real threat for is all other smart contract chains that are years behind scalability solutions. Ethereum can scale today via rollups to the order of thousands of tps, building the know-how and infrastructure to do so took years. If your smart contract blockchain of choice is starting now to tackle this problem it's very very late to the party. Do with this information whatever you want.

You can check all currently available L2 solutions and learn a lot about their properties here: https://l2beat.com/",1635939147,hj4vtg7
"Just compare the market cap of Loopring to that of a similar popular project, MATIC.
Matic has almost 14 billion market cap and LRC is at 1.6 billion as of this comment. That's a potential increase of 9x just to be where Matic is. 

Now just take into account that a shitcoin like Shiba Inu has a market cap of 38 billion and you can appreciate the LRC and GameStop connection.",1635938383,hj4umn1

Zk-rollups(like loopring) are true L2s, and Polygon is working to launch its own zk service. With a Zk rollup like loopring, even if loopring goes down, you can still transfer your assets back to the main chain. Zk rollups are the only l2's that fully inherit the security of the main chain - sidechains do not inherit any security, and so are much more centralized.",1638992166,hnr8k01

But once they do roll out, I find it hard to believe corporations, retail investors, and whales would use Matic when LRC is running full steam. They would essentially be choosing to pay more and take more time for the same thing LRC offers.

"MATIC is the native token of Polygon, it’s used for gas and to secure the network. 

Polygon leverages Ethereum because the validation of Polygon occurs in Ethereum. There’s a lot more layers to it but that’s what you need to know. 

A rollup is a method of scaling chains like Ethereum but it wont be unique to Ethereum—all chains like Cardano, Avalanche, etc. will eventually need them. 

By “rolling up” transactions off chain and sending them to the main chain as one whole transaction, you can significantly reduce network load. 

Think about it this way, instead of making 1000 transactions on chain at $20 per transaction, why not do the 1000 transactions off chain and “rolling it up” as 1 transaction for a $20 fee ($0.02 per transaction).

Examples of rollups are Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZkSync, Starknet, PolygonHermez, Polygon Miden.",1638970350,hnpr7bo

"We'll see true magic earlier that than. The biggest grievance with Ethereum is obviously the high cost of using it right now.

But the solution is already rolling out, its layer2 rollups!

The end goal of Ethereum is for users to do almost all their transactions on Layer 2 solutions. You’’ll be able to buy some ETH on [Coinbase](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-protocol-team-advances-crypto-community-aa9b3748bac5), send it through Optimism or Arbitrum to something like [Hop](https://hop.exchange/) where you’ll be able to hop on to immutable to buy an NFT, which you’ll be able to move to another L2 where you can use it as collateral for a loan.

Examples of Layer 2 solutions are:

-	[Optimism](https://optimism.io/) 
-	[Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.one) 
-	[dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/), Using [Starkware](https://starkware.co/) 
-	[Immutable X](https://www.immutable.com/) - NFT's
-	[Hermez](https://hermez.io/)
-	[Aztec](https://aztec.network/)
-	[ZKSync](https://zksync.io/)
-	[Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/)

TL;DR

[The Merge](https://ethmerge.com/) (move to proof of stake), sometimes refered to as ETH 2.0 will make Ethereum eco friendly, and drop issuance of new ETH by 87%. And layer2 rollups will solve the high fees.",1636044372,hjavq8w

Thoughts on loopring future?,1636039443,hjaiwd0
"Let me lay down some unpopular truth on y'all, since it seems you've nearly all gone bananas.  
That lrc / gme thing you have going on is such a miniscule piece of the cryptoverse that all you're doing is providing exit liquidity to early investors who are now dumping on you. Despite what you may believe, the whole fucking financial world doesn't revolve around your beliefs and outside your bubble nobody really cares neither about gme nor loopring. I won't comment on gme, but if you have any delusions about some grand profits on lrc due to some nft stuff, just check how much nft traffic is on ethereum alone, and on other established chains that are absolutely massive and with a developed ecosystem and are only scraping the bottom of the barrel against Ethereum, and you're honestly expecting some magic based on rumor / hype for some potential event on some L2 that has no ecosystem and is fighting against Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism?  
Not a fat fucking chance. Hopefully some pulled off a good swing play, which is all these shitcoins are good for, including those that are shilled right now, and all they do is bleed and make you lose money versus BTC and eth, not even mentioning the true racehorses of this cycle.  
Earlier this year some of the ckb and ftm shills today were crying about skl and grt. Do yourself a favor, open trading view and enter btc/yourcoin or eth/yourcoin or if you want your eyes to bleed, sol/yourcoin and see how well those returns panned out.

"And we should but the market makers are trying to profit off the recent run up like they always do by shorting the shit out of it. 

We can all watch $LRC crater down to &lt;$1 while lining the pockets of the same greedy funds and money managers that we all taught a lesson in GME or we can sit idly by with our thumbs probing our anal recesses.

To those in particular who are hodling $GME:

Yes, diamond hands. Never sell. It's more than a stock, it's a love. I agree which is why I put my 401k into it every month like clockwork. I love $GME like I love my wife and my child.

Now, I loved my wife with all my heart when our daughter was born. And now I love her equally, she is a part of my wife. 

And Loopring is a part of $GME now. It's child, so to speak. And it is worthy of equal love. To say you love $GME yet not have an equal store of how we show love here: money, in $LRC is not really love.

The successes of $LRC and $GME are now intertwined--one is the same as the other. And to root for $GME while not supporting $LRC is to be a hypocrite. If $LRC fails, so does $GME.

If you have liquid funds, please help $LRC. If you have them tied up in $GME, and take pride in your diamond hands, show the same courtesy to baby GME: $LRC. By not hodling any LRC, you have already sold both.

Let's teach those crypto market makers the same lesson we taught the stock manipulators. $LRC &amp; $GME to da moon!!!

to a nation’s control over money, a combinatorial protocol  
that can match traders (consumers/producers) at scale, is a  
theoretical threat to the concept of money itself.""

"From Kraken who has an extremely thorough write up on lrc.

[kraken - what is loopring](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/learn/what-is-loopring-lrc)


Why Does LRC Have Value?

The Loopring cryptocurrency, LRC, is necessary for key operations on the protocol. 

For instance, anyone who wishes to operate a decentralized exchange on Loopring must lock up at least 250,000 LRC, which enables the operator to run an exchange that uses its on-chain data proofs. An operator must stake 1 million LRC to run an exchange without this feature. 

Further, LRC helps incentivize the proper use of the Loopring network. Exchange operators who deposit LRC could even have deposits confiscated by the protocol if they operate exchanges poorly. These confiscated funds would then be distributed to users who choose to stake their tokens.

Elsewhere, any user can stake LRC to earn a portion of trading fees paid to the protocol. 

Some 70% of fees are distributed to users who stake LRC. A further 20% is allocated to the Loopring Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which is designed to allow a pool of funds to be spent at the discretion of Loopring users in future. 

Finally, 10% of fees are burned. This means the total supply of LRC will decrease over time, putting pressure on its price. The total supply of LRC is capped at 1.395 million tokens. ",1636017855,hj9fm1p

"Gme won't make a decentralized stock exchange lol. If they do I'll just retire right then and there. They'll create an nft marketplace, likely bootstrapped by their connection with game devs, but overall general purpose. They may give out an nft dividend to fuck the shorts.

Loopring counterfactual wallet sounds like a pretty reasonable response to the current price tag. Been in discussion since at least august and allows interaction with both layer-1 and -2 without paying full $160 price. Option then to pay for wallet cost at later date.

"Great response to you both, this is how I feel over there as well. Generally I come at it that crypto as a whole is going to be soo big, it’s not about 1 coin or the other. There’s enough space for a lot of similar coins to exist rather happily, and in fact, there needs to be multiple offerings of similar coins for a healthy dose of competition for improvement.

Loopring just seems primed to go and it has a future with hardly any downsides that are evident at this point. Being part of that must just help to create a happy community I guess",1639346558,hoav9rm
"Honestly, I don't even think we've seen this thing really run. We had a frenzy over some leaked references to GameStop in the Loopring source code and some apes jumping in. 

I don't think the majority of that community has come on board yet and if LRC is name dropped by Ryan Cohen you'll see the floodgates open up and really rocket this bitch. They're cult like and probably one of the biggest communities that actually take action on things they believe in. 

Mass exodus of users from RobinHood trading platform. Over $100,000 donated in a sub-wide fundraiser to Toys for Tots and 5 million shares directly registered as of October (published through GameStop, basically unheard of for individuals to lock up 7% of officially reported shares). This number is growing by the day, especially after some poorly received updates from Fidelity about them being able to sell positions if it's in the interest of their business. 

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I spent too much time down the rabbit hole but if there's one community I'm willing to risk betting on, it's the apes that are entrenched in the GME saga. 

Also, LRC can't be the biggest scam in a world where Bitconnect, SHIB, and SquidGame exist lol",1639346493,hoav463

It's a fun community with a lot of hype. But no one is claiming a get rich quick scheme. Most if not all believe it is a long-term hold, great retirement plan if you will. But the partnership with GME would give it a large price jump quickly and that would be nice. The teasers from GME and LRC have been ridiculous at this point an announcement seems inevitable.

Ive got XX GME/XXXX AMC shares since pre January market halt. I made a promise not to invest in anything else outside of this play, but Crytpo keeps popping up in convo and now I can’t unsee it. It’s clearly the way of the future and I would be unwise to not listen to my gut. 

Fuck the stock market after this MOASS squeeze happens soon, I’m going to be grabbing my tendies and investing back into GME/AMC only and putting my millions into my Crypto coins to diversity for the future. NFA",1638855861,hnk85rz

"So I would tell you to dca at every 20% pump you make if and only if it is consecutive in a short period, also knowing your cash limits is important if you did it that way, hence something i cannot afford. As for the weekly Dca this would in theory allow you to climb up or ride a low bringing average down and that was my main plan. I got carried away after making a small gain though it was 125%er so it felt good, I then chased another pump and have seen the price fluctuate so rapidly(loopring) that I could have brought my average down by a dollar if I was smart, but I am not one to time the market and it was in my head that I had to invest earlier as the gamestop announcement they are supposedly making is happening in q4 so I have just been holding onto a 3.82 CAD average which sucks as I could have made more money. Always go slowly into an investment as up or down you will make gains that way, if you dump all in you risk a huge turn against you, if you DCa you can make assessment as you go to either stop investing or keep going in deeper. This is all relative to your skills and funds though in my opinion and a huge amount of risk tolerance to go all in, you will lose money I can tell you because that's where I'm at barely breaking even now due to this big bet on loopring, though im confident in the protocol so no worries that I will make it and then some. And as for true movement I have been analyzing the charts every single day and it seems when it happens you can set an alert and realize gains on a short or go long if you truly believe it will go further, I dunno 5% to me is a big deal and you can cut the short there and be happy, Im still learning what I plan to do through trial and error wish me luck.",1638852980,hnk34jj

"Feel like we’ve entered a point of misinformation with all the Loopring hype at this point. 

Loopring does not compete with Polygon and xDai. They are side chains with general purposes, meaning you can build all sorts of Dapps and games on top of them. Loopring only supports the building of wallets, dexes, AMMs, and payment apps.

The advantage of Loopring is that it’s built on Ethereum’s security and consensus whereas side chains are only able to leverage it. More accurately, Loopring competes with payment-only zkRollups like PolygonHermez.

I’m not sure if it’s in their roadmap but they can compete against side chains and other Rollups—specifically optimistic Rollups—in the future by joining the likes of ZkSync, Starknet, and PolygonMiden.",1638849383,hnjvx57

"Ethereum L1 has high gas fees because of computational power needed to validate each transaction being written on the block chain. On Layer 1, each transaction is a block. You can see it as a private chauffeur to bring your own transaction to the chain. 

With Layer 2, your transaction gets hashed, stripped from unnecessary data (while being saved on L2) and pooled with several other transactions (compressed)  into a same block, before being pushed onto the Layer 1 highway (block chain)

Using Layer 2 rollups is like hopping on a bus and sharing the gas cost with all passengers, as opposed to having your own private driver.

ZkRollups like Loopring preserve the security and functionality (smart contracts) of Ethereum, while increasing throughput (transactions per second) hundred folds. 

When ETH finally evolves to sharding, Loopring's tps will surpass Visa's transactions per second.

-	LTO has been knocked out of the Top 5 chart (slipping to 7th place) and replaced by DOT, which saw a huge 230% increase in mentions in the past day. 
-	Special mentions also go out to ONE (10th place) and LTC (13th place), which have both also seen 200%+ increases in mentions.

"They are all centralized but a true layer 2, which can't be named can't take your assets because it runs on top of layer 1. Not a side chain.  
  
I find this comment from a previous post that explains it better. 
  
&gt; The key here is that it’s non-custodial. If L2 is shut down right now for whatever reason you can pull all your funds back to L1 without it.

L2 is a mostly-centralized convenience that uses the Ethereum blockchain “behind the scenes” to enforce the user’s ownership and safety of their assets.

So while that comment points out a valid criticism to the whole “decentralization/DEX” classification of Loopring’s L2, it then draws a false comparison equating this centralization to loss of ownership and security of your assets (akin to Binance) which simply is not the case.

Your tokens are yours at all times, Loopring org can shut down their L2 at anytime but never 1. Steal your assets or 2. Prevent you from utilizing L1 (Ethereum blockchain transactions) to withdraw your assets.",1640186975,hpkdciv

"&gt; It is very expensive (not important)

High usage of the base layer is a good thing, and rollups are already drastically lowering costs for end-users. You can do trading on Loopring and ZKsync for next to nothing gas-wise. 

&gt; Proof of stake - miners are no longer interests

That's a good thing. 

&gt; High gas fees - why not go to another chain/coin

See my first reply. 

&gt; Smart contracts? - other coins/chains have smart contracts

Yep, and many of them use the Ethereum Virtual Machine in some capacity, both BSC and AVAX do. It's very easy to spin up a fork of ETH and have a chain with smart contracts. It's much harder to actually build the associated ecosystem with the same level of decentralization. 

&gt; Infrastructure - other coins also have good infrastructure

Not nearly on the same level as Ethereum. The sheer amount of tooling and dev resources and the huge number of devs in the ecosystem is a near-insurmountable advantage for Ethereum.",1640176711,hpjt5y9

"Do you realize that any and every time you settle into L1 you pay gas fees, no matter what? The whole point of Layer 2 is building an ecosystem that is more user friendly, more scalable, cheaper and faster for the average user. Of course you will pay gas fees for the creation of the full wallet _because it is a smart contract on Ethereum_.

The counterfactual wallet (counterfactual means undeployed) is a huge leap forward because it allows the users to reside on L2 and don't touch L1 unless they 100% want to. Think of Eth as TCP/IP and L2 the web you browse: You don't need to know about TCP/IP to use a webpage.

The fiat on ramp into L2 means you do not have to go to a CEX or a swap burning a lot of gas fees or losing money in extra transactions just to end operating in L2. It means you can load your L2 wallet from your debit card and operate there, pretty much gas free.

Loopring has been working with the Ethereum foundation in making the EVM zk-compatible. This is huge, because it means that in the near future, zkRollups will not be limited to transactions on layer 2. They could build an entire ecosystem of dapps if they wanted to, all much faster and cheaper than ever in L1.

2022 is the year of rollups. Make your choices, or better yet, bet in everyone. Because it is going to be big. This is not financial advice.",1640125106,hphbiv8

"https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/pcv57u/mods_can_we_get_a_mega_thread_on_gas_fees/

1. Gas fees are high because usage is high.
2. This is not easily solvable by other blockchains, due to the [blockchain trilemma](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html).
3. This is not solved by EIP-1559. EIP-1559 solves [other problems](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559#motivation)
4. This will not be solved by ''ETH 2.0"", ETH2 is [the change from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake](https://ethmerge.com/).
5. This **will* be solved by Layer 2. Lots of people are working on solutions. (See below)
6. In the future, [data shards](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/) will significantly decrease fees on these solutions, but not on L1.
7. Gas fees are not at 1000 gwei all the time, as some screenshots might suggest. You can see the historic average gas price on [gasnow.org](https://www.gasnow.org/)

The end goal of Ethereum is for users to do almost all their transactions on Layer 2 solutions. You''ll be able to buy some ETH on [Coinbase](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-protocol-team-advances-crypto-community-aa9b3748bac5), send it through Optimism or Arbitrum to something like [Hop](https://hop.exchange/) where you'll be able to hop on to immutable to buy an NFT, which you'll be able to move to another L2 where you can use it as collateral for a loan.

Examples of Layer 2 solutions are:

- [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) - Already usable in alpha phase
- [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.one) - Coming within the next few days
- [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/), Using [Starkware](https://starkware.co/) - One of the first, already usable perpetual trading platform.
- [Immutable X](https://www.immutable.com/) - Already usable, NFT market (focus on games)
- [Hermez](https://hermez.io/)
- [Aztec](https://aztec.network/)

The rumor broke 2 weeks ago and was the primary driver of both the price gain of looping and GameStop stock. So investors have already priced that into the value.

It's one of the original layer 2 solutions to ethereums gas problem and there is nothing fishy about it whatsoever. Polygon is a side chain - essentially a low-fee eth fork that is not secured by the ethereum network. Loopring IS secured by ethereum.


That said, you -do not need- LRC to use loopring as a rollup or to trade, provide liquidity etc on their AMM (decentralized exchange like uniswap but on layer 2) and fees can be paid in eth or usdc or whatever really, and I was stoked when LRC pumped to 70 cents a month or so ago.

In 2018 when the bear market hit, it was the HARDEST crash of them all without a doubt and many coins didn’t even survive must less recover fully.

So, just take with a grain of salt. If it can not bleed as heavily against Bitcoin as ALL alt did in the bear market it may have a lot of upside coming.

"I posted this as a comment to someone, felt it might help others understand WHY there is a hype around LRC thus creating a new comment. 


Of course I'd suggest to do your own research but here's a bit of a summary. Feel free to help me add the sources:


Facts: 


1. Listed as a coin to watch on Greyscale (Canadian retirement fund with $40bn AUM) the previous coin to get accepted 2x'd in the same month. Source: Founder on twitter posting screenshot of document from Greyscale



2. Fee-less wallet will launch this week on the L2. So setting up a wallet which currently costs 150usd will become 0. Source: their Dev's on discord. Update: New changes on GitHub reflect this already! 



3. Staking will also be available via their official wallet 



4. Bank of China Patent includes use of LRC as you may be aware of it. 



5. Q4 2021 announcement nearing everyday 



6. GitHub code shows GameStop services mentioned twice. One time regarding export of NFT and later on in the second leak showed their beta testing url (staging server) whose SSL certificate ownership lies with GameStop.


7. 10% burn on transaction fees 



8. Exchanges if they want to use loopring need to hold 250k LRC on-chain or 1m LRC off-chain - which means every new exchange on this will reduce the supply of coins on the market.


9. The new wallet supports Fiat ramp-on and Fiat ramp-off 

Opinion:



1. GME announcement about their NFT market place will be a huge 10x event for the coin 



2. Relatively low market cap and wide wallet acceptance will sky rocket the price



Note: I have tried being as bias free as possible but I want to let the community know that 100% of my portfolio is LRC. It's equivalent to my one month salary for perspective.",1636427354,hjw27ep

My thought is that if the rumors are true and GameStop does announce an official partnership with LoopRing for their NFT marketplace, the price is going to go parabolic.

Ckb, avalanche, one etc. are all ethereum compatible as well, so they help unlock the potential of eth.

"&gt;And soon there will be a wallet with no ETH20 required gas fees.

How?   Are you saying that if I have an ERC20 token in my ledger wallet... It's going to be possible to move it to Coinbase and sell it for dollars without paying gas fees using Loopring?  Because that's the tone of the hype around LRC and from what I can tell it's false.

As far as I can tell it's an L2 dex that let's you swap ERC20 tokens around and trade one for another back and forth for low fees (not gas).   But at the end of the day if I want to actually move any of those tokens (or ETH itself) from one wallet to another, there's no getting around paying a gas fee on chain.

It's like bitcoins lightning.   In the end there's a fee to settle on the main chain.   Except in the case of LRC you're swapping one token for another instead of just sending them one way in the case of lighting.

I'm not saying it's not great and useful tech.  I'm saying all the ""You never have to pay ETH gas fees with Loopring!"" Hype is fake.  It only works in the use case of exchanging tokens off chain.  But still needs a gas fee to finally settle on chain.  And in that respect, the supposed ""security backed up by ETH"" is really disingenuous since all the swaps aren't secured by ETH at all.  Until they settle.",1636499421,hjzy5sy

-	Special mentions also go out to BAT (10th place) and LTC (12th place), which have both seen 400%+ increases in mentions over the past day.

"tldr; Chinese startup Loopring has released a new payment product called Loopring Pay. It's built on top of zkRollup, an ETH Layer 2 scaling protocol using zkSNARKS. It allows users to send ETH and ERC20 tokens without worrying about Ethereum’s usual congestion and expensive gas fees.

"Yes and no!

It truely has the potential to be the next 'big' coin. It certainly has the tech! But the biggest factor will be the community.

If the Gamestop announcement comes, GME holders will probably buy LRC. We all know how strong that community is so the rise would be insane. Those people will also produce a lot of memes. r/loopringorg already has tons of memes. This might sound unimportant but we know how strong the meme-crypto community is. They can skyrocket certain ''stupid'' coins just for the meme. So if that community starts to join a coin with potential, this could become insane.

However, what happened with Solana was out of this world. Only time will tell if Loopring will be *that* succesfull. But waiting one year to find out won't hurt... We know for sure that it will rise! How much is still up for debate, but rising it will!",1636538420,hk1uhad

Fundamentally, Polygon's vision is to build an ecosystem of products that allow people to scale, use, and develop on Ethereum. The most well known of these right now is the Polygon PoS chain. 

The Polygon PoS chain is built so that anyone can develop anything they'd like on it. It's a general purpose solution.

Loopring takes a different approach. It's not open for anyone to develop on. They are building specific products on their solution (e.g., the rumored GameStop NFT marketplace). This targeted approach at what is built on their protocol allows a few things, two of which are; quality control and hyper optimization.

This gives Loopring an edge in a niche market, which I foresee them using to build financial infrastructure as well as for corporate clients to have purpose built, highly optimized marketplaces.",1636325638,hjqgnq1

**Biggest Changes:**

-	BTC and ETH have yet again swapped positions, with ETH taking spot today (whereas yesterday it was BTC). 
-	ADA has entered the Top 5 Chart for the first time in more than two weeks, following a 38% increase in mentions over the past day and replacing CRO, which has slipped to 8th place.
-	Other than that, both LRC and CKB retain their 3rd and 5th places respectively for a second day in a row.

"My thought is crypto technology is its ridiculous how much you get ripped off for fees. I don't of these discussions get buried under shill posts or just removed but they charge WAY MORE fees then traditional investing and there is ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE HELP. 

First you ""HAVE TO"" use a digital wallet. You just have to. And they will charge your account conversion fees between different forms of ether.

Plus these digital wallets like Coinbase who advertise incentives for you to choosing their nickel &amp; dime you to death wallet do not honor those incentives they advertised when you sign up. I know personally, outside myself eight other people who all said the same thing. You can contact customer service show them their own advertisement and how that does not reflect in your but they will not respond. 

This is your introduction to this bullshit platform for nerds who can't even explain their own bullshit they espouse in these forums. I can't tell you how many times I have seen people say ""Buy Loopring its the future its going to reach the stars!"" Then they begin to chip away at your money with ridiculous ass fees whose pricing fluctuates meaning you never know.

There are the fees between sites.  

There is the different sites themselves that charge a users a ""gas fee"" for a fucking automated computer function!!! 

The fee for minting a token

The fee for  selling.

You won't be exposed to conflicting opinions in specific subs. You will find biased and optimistic musings of people who are either a) holding a stack way bigger than they should, b) people that are new to the coin and trying to convince themselves the hype buy was worth it, c)people looking for legitimate info on the coin(subs like loopring and ada I've found extremely informative, and lastly d) the people actively trying to prey on hype and create a pump and dump.

So far in the past few weeks there has been ankr, mana and now loopring. Three easy opportunities to x2 your money.  Anyone that's been involved in crypto for any reasonable amount of time understands this. Lrc was never a  long term hold. These pumps, which there have been many, are short term things. You get in, make your money and then get out. Just because there is 1000 people shouting ape on some reddit forum doesn't mean anything and the more you get wrapped up in it the more you will lose.

"Yes, it's an old coin thats been around for 4 years that's been talked about extensively and sat around 5 to 10 cents for most of its life.

The people that are ""discovering"" it now as if it's some sort of amazing new project are strange because it's been one of the most publicized L2 solutions since it's inception. People have talked about loopring here for years, just few people cared because there are already other l2 scaling solutions that are ahead of them such as matic  and arbitrum.

However, I have a feeling the people that are discovering an old project for the first time aren't exactly the kind of people who follow any kind of crypto news, so I guess it's cool to see them interested - it's just funny to hear ""we're so early"" on a project that's:

- older than most 
- up a huge amount based entirely on hype and ""gamestop""",1636846357,hkin03m

So essentially LRC would be the toll to use the tech? Like if you want to use the tollway and get to where you want to more efficiently/quicker, you pay the toll?

And companies that partner with Loopring or license its tech to have their own exchanges/marketplaces, would have to load up on LRC and integrate it into same, so the millions of consumers/traders on any given exchange/marketplace wouldn’t each need to have LRC?

Maybe it’s NFTs, maybe it’s a loopring partnership or partnership with someone else, or maybe something altogether different.  If that happens and the next earnings report happens and there is no moass it’s probably pretty safe to assume it’s not happening.  Other than that it would be if people actually direct register enough float so that the stock can’t be manipulated with synthetic shares.  If that happens and there is no margin call triggering moass then the theories were wrong.  All of that should come to pass by end of Q4 by my understanding.",1636843819,hkih0ez

Why are Doge and Shiba and all those other shitcoins higher when Loopring is definitely coming out with an NFT marketplace? They already said so in their Q3 report. The “allegedly” part is referring to whether or not the partnership is with GME. They haven’t come out and said it yet, but the facts are: Matt Finestone went from Loopring to GameStop, there were multiple code leaks, and a guy who interviewed with GameStop confirmed it too, among other things. So even that seems likely to me.

"Polygon technically doesn't speed up the ethereum network. Polygon is a side chain, not a layer 2. That's because it doesn't rely on ethereum security. Instead, it relies on its own (much smaller) pool of validators. If Polygon is 34% attacked, it will fail, and there is nothing the ethereum network can do about that. For a true L2 like Arbitrum to fail, ethereum itself needs to be 51% attacked.

So Polygon isn't so much an enhancer of ethereum as it is an emulator of ethereum that is attached at the hip. It is its own chain; it just posts its state to the ethereum network from time to time. It is EVM compatible, which basically means that any protocol built on L1 ethereum can be instantly ported over to Polygon, which is why its DeFi ecosystem has so many dapps and protocols on it that make it feel very much like L1 ethereum.

Polygon gets way, way lower gas fees than even optimistic rollup L2s (by orders of magnitude) but it pays for this amazing scaling in the trilemma by having inferior security and decentralization.

Most people believe the future of scaling is not side chains but L2s using optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups (Arbitrum, Optimisim, zkSwap, Loopring, etc.). Polygon was kind of an excellent bandaid solution that came in and saved the DeFi day in the spring when L1 ethereum gas first got outrageous.

However, Polygon does have rollups on their roadmap (Polygon Hermez has already launched with zk rollups, but there isn't really any TVL at all yet); both optimistic and zero-knowledge I believe. Once Polygon's main network becomes rollup-based, it would become a true layer 2.

Loopring is doing a lot of research on things like [shared liquidity between different L2s](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/composability-between-ethereum-layer-1-and-2-10650b7411e5) and [composability between the L1 and an L2](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/composability-between-ethereum-layer-1-and-2-10650b7411e5), which would allow StarkNet to piggyback off Loopring's liquidity, or even communicate with Loopring or another ZK rollup through L1 &lt;-&gt; L2 composability.",1636249470,hjmhmng

&amp;#x200B;

    LOOPRING'S VISION
    Loopring builds protocols, infrastructure, and user-facing products for the future of finance. We believe this future is built on Ethereum, and specifically on layer 2 (zkRollups).
    Users of decentralized finance (DeFi) need not choose between security and performance. Loopring's L2 provides a low-fee, high-speed platform for trading, swapping, liquidity providing, and payments - without sacrificing Ethereum security at all.
    We envision a digital economy where users are empowered and always in control of their assets. Loopring has succeeded in proving that non-custodial technology can replicate custodial alternatives in speed, cost, and experience. We have made DEXes as performant as CEXes, and will outcompete incumbent fintech.
    Loopring's objective is to design and engineer the best-in-class zkRollup exchange and payment protocol on Ethereum, and to operate products that bring it to users across the world

Polygon is essentially a sidechain, it doesn't act the same as something like Arbitrum or Loopring, because of that it doesn't inherit the same security that those do. It's not too different from any EVM compatible chain with an ETH bridge, like AVAX, BSC, or FTM.

Requiring a separate token for gas is kind of self explanatory, just a minor annoyance, but again is something specific to Polygon.

5/8 multisig means that there are 8 people who have the ability to sign off on changes to Polygon, and only 5 of them are needed for the change to go through. [It's detailed better here.](https://defiwatch.net/second-letter-to-polygon/)

Distribution of MATIC between validators is skewed heavily towards the top, meaning they could collude to alter the network. I can't find the link I saw but you can check the list of validators to see who has the most, Binance has .5B MATIC delegated and Polygon says they aim for 30% of circ. supply staked which is only 2.1B.",1636579100,hk4b0zs

"You have some really good timing. Your friend got you in right at the perfect moment last bull run. You're asking for advice at the perfect time this bull run! Good on ya!

Loopring is a coin that's been around for a while and it survived the last bear market. It has really good utility and it has some major announcements coming in the pipeline (GameStop partnership and others) that will make it explode. Besides the coin itself Loopring has amazing community support behind it. If you've heard anything about the GameStop saga in the stock market you'll know the GME Apes don't mess around. Those same GME Apes are backing this coin as GameStop looks to pivot into the NFT gaming marketplace. 

If you were to invest in Loopring you would be VERY early. It's likely to hit $10 on the GME partnership alone. It could be $30-$50 by the end of this bull run. Loopring (LRC) is trading at $1.32 as I'm writing this and it's about to go parabolic in the next few days.

"ZK rollups are a type of rollup, which in itself is a form of Layer 2 scaling solution.

Rollups essentially take both off-chain and potentially on-chain transactions and will execute them off chain, typically using a system or a network that focuses primarily on speed over security, and will then posted transaction data on chain in a highly compressed form, where transactions will inherit the security of the underlying L1 chain.

There needs to be some way to verify the validity of this posted transaction data from the L1 chain, though, and so there are generally two types of rollups:
- Optimistic rollups, which will post transaction data on chain but will provide a period of time (say, a few days) for L1 peers to verify the validity of the posted data, and will allow L1 peers to content/attest the validity of the posted data.
- ZK rollups, which will post transaction data on chain, accompanied with another piece of data called a zero-knowledge proof, that L1 peers can use to test the validity of the transaction data, without needing to know the full transaction data, only the data that was posted on chain.

Both forms of rollups deliver scalability improvements, but have different upsides and downsides:
- Optimistic rollups are generally easier to make support the EVM (which is the beating heart of Ethereum), and so can support a dapp ecosystem similar to the one we take for granted on the L1 chain, but they're less secure and have longer finality periods (it takes longer for transaction data to fully settle on the L1 chain since they allow L1 peers to contest/attest the validity of the posted data, often taking days).
- ZK rollups are more secure and have much faster finality periods (minutes vs days), and hence are able to support more advanced technologies that can be deployed within L2s ([shared liquidity between L2s via dAMMs](https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3), [L1 &lt;-&gt; L2 composability via a middleman solution](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/composability-between-ethereum-layer-1-and-2-10650b7411e5), etc), but they have higher hardware requirements for nodes on the L2 side (generating ZK proofs is difficult), and they're harder to make support the EVM (meaning that there isn't a proper dapp ecosystem available for them, *yet*, though there are a few different projects in the works that aim to bring EVM-compatible ZK rollups to the public).

As for what projects are available for each type:
- For optimistic rollups, we have Arbitrum and Optimism as the main two, with a few smaller and more niche ones floating around.
- For ZK rollups, we have Loopring, ZKSwap and dYdX all acting as dexs hosted within their own ZK rollups, we have zkSync and Polygon Hermez acting as transfer services hosted within their own ZK rollups, and we also have StarkNet and Polygon Hermez (same entity, different rollup) as EVM-compatible general-purpose (ie dapp-supporting) ZK rollups that are still in the research phase.",1636290701,hjo3wr0

This is 100% GME related re: the NFT exchange (and you can check my post history to confirm I'm an OG GMEtard). You don't have to buy LRC. Just providing this as information and HYPE  
  
Direct translation:  
  
Ten years to grind a sword  
  
The frosty blade has never been tried  
  
Today it's shown to the lord/monarch  
  
Who has injustice?  
  
Meaning and analysis (my take)  
  
This guy has built Loopring for \~10 year (or some number of years). It's fucking sharp. It's ready to kill. It's never been tested. The original poem is explained to mean something like: now the swordmaker shows the king the sword and asks him ""who has experienced injustice?"" The implication is that he's ready to do battle for those who have been wronged.  
  
This feels like: okay, Loopring built this amazing tool, and they found the ""king"" aka Ryan Cohen and GameStop. And he's ready to fight the noble battle. The sword is only as good as the use it's put to.  
  
Remember Cohen's tweet with the sumo wrestlers? They are doing battle against the tech titans. This is about Power to the Players. This is about deploying the NFT exchange, and it is coming soon!  
  
Edit: and let me just add, these lines are from Tang Dynasty poet Jia Du. So the poem is like 1300 years old.

Imagine a world where everything from season tickets to sporting events to ownership rights on intellectual property (songs, movies, patents), physical property (real estate) to actual shares in a company are traded as NFTs or fractionalized NFTs. Imagine if organizations start issuing shares of their company as fractions of an NFT to ensure hedge funds aren't creating phantom shares or naked short selling. 

A world where people are expected to attend work virtually but not over Zoom meetings, rather in a virtual meeting room with a virtual dress code. Those clothes you wear in these virtual rooms are NFTs.

Now imagine the company that is positioning itself to be the Amazon equivalent of these virtual assets is GameStop and their primary partner is Loopring.

"With Layer 2, you can essentially open a tab with a bar. Instead of having to pay for each and every transaction, you only have to pay at the end of the month. This makes the exchange much much more efficient.

This would be especially useful when you’re making tons of transactions at a time like, say, when you’re opening a tab during a party. 

Layer 2 roll ups like Loopring and Arbitrum is another one, “roll-up” or bundle Ethereum transactions at certain intervals. If the gas fee of Ethereum is $20 and you managed to roll up 1000 transactions in the Layer 2 as one transaction in the Layer 1, that means each Layer 2 transaction is worth $0.2 or $20 dollars split between 1000 transactions.",1635809302,hiy301b

Polygon is as of now is focused on being a general purpose solution that allows anyone to develop on it.

LoopRing is a layer 2 ZK roll-up. This means it inherits all of Ethereum's security. LoopRing is focused on building targeted products on their platform as opposed to allowing general development.

"Just because I keep hearing people mentioning MATIC:

Polygon Matic is not an L2, it's a side chain. People refer to side chains as L2s, but they're not. An L2 builds on top of an underlying chain (hence the name, Layer 2), inheriting the security of the underlying chain. A side chain is as it sounds, it's an entirely separate, independent blockchain with its own consensus and security, that is linked to the L1 chain via a bridge.

Funds in an L2 still exist on the L1, just locked up in a smart contract deployed to the L1, and the smart contract can be designed to allow direct exits from the L1. Funds in a side chain do not exist on the L1, they exist on the side chain, and need to be bridged back if you want to access them on the side chain.

Polygon Matic was simply the first to be adopted, but actual L2s such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, zkSync or ZKSwap are the better option, because they're more secure and more user friendly. Plus, L2s can scale with the L1 chain, because one of the main bottlenecks of L2s is data availability, as L2s do what they do by more efficiently using limited block space.

"Yes, it's just a rumor at this point, but it's more than just the github code. For instance the head of blockchain for GME is Matthew Finestone, who was the business director for loopring before joining GME. He has also been interacting with a smart contract that controls the ENS domain gamestop.loopring.eth. Sure, it's just rumors, but they're pretty convincing rumors when the head of blockchain for GME is a former director of Loopring and is interacting with an ENS for loopring that has gamestop in the name.

"Would imagine that the gas fees are being payed for indirectly through exchange fees to use the exchange. Loopring is the odd one out, here, as most other rollups that I know of still charge gas fees within the L2, just they're very cheap.

Also keep in mind that a rollup works by batching many transactions together, so it's basically posting, say, 100 L2 transactions onto the L1, with just a single L1 transaction, incurring just a single L1 fee.",1635865380,hj0oqha
As far as I can tell loop ring doesn't support smart contracts? In which case I don't see how it can become the core of nfts for the gaming industry as no game company would be able to create the required contracts to actually integrate their NFT's with their games on loopring.,1635865354,hj0oo8l
They said LTC. You've got a bad case of Loopring worm.,1635865322,hj0oliq
"A few additional comments I feel are important. All NFT market places won’t switch to Loopring just because gas fees are low. 

So what does this mean?

No gas fees will segment the NFT space to a common, and premium market where LRC can take over the common space. Most games and DLC is under $60 so there is no market for such NFT if gas fees are $80. The lower gas fees opens the market place to allow for lower priced NFT trading to occur.

Competition: What about Polygon?

Loopring has fundamentally better tech as it’s built on top of ETH while Polygon runs “side car” and is still subject to the drawbacks of a POS model. This  off-chain model along zkRollup tech allows Loopring to leverage its faster speeds with the security of ETH to achieve a better overall blockchain.

The rollout by LRC is just the beginning. Buckle up.",1635865259,hj0og74
Loopring. (LRC),1635864993,hj0ntah
"Yes, but actually no. Both projects are scaling solutions that are designed to increase throughput (and hence reduce fees) from the perspective of the user, but they go about it in two *very* different ways.

Polygon Matic is an example of something called a side chain. This is essentially an entirely separate blockchain, with its own consensus and security, that is designed to be easy to link to other chains via a set of bridges, essentially acting as an external ecosystem that is compatible with the linked-to chain, while offering better scalability at the cost of some security. You move your funds to a side chain, they now exist on that side chain.

Loopring is an example of something called a rollup. Rollups are a bit more complicated, but are basically systems that sit on top of a chain and keep one foot in the chain through a set of smart contracts deployed to that chain. Rollups essentially take a set of transactions and will execute them off chain, but will then post transaction data on chain in a highly compressed form as part of the deployed smart contract(s), with some mechanisms in place to verify and contest/attest the validity of the posted transaction data. You move your funds to a rollup, they now exist within a smart contract that is deployed to the underlying chain.

That should have already highlighted the major difference between the two, but in case it didn't, with a rollup, your funds are still kept on chain, making rollups more secure (since they inherit the security of the underlying chain), and more user friendly (since you can exit a rollup directly from the L1 chain, whereas with a side chain you'd need to move your assets back through a bridge). So, in a way, rollups are accomplishing the same thing as Polygon Matic, *but* Loopring in particular is not.

See, Loopring is *actually* an example of something called a ZK rollup. The kinda quick tl;dr here is that there are two kinds of rollups: optimistic rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism), and ZK rollups (Loopring, dYdX, zkSync, ZKSwap).

Optimistic rollups assume that all posted transaction data is valid, and will give the rest of the underlying chain some time to verify the validity and contest/attest the validity of the posted transaction data. However, ZK rollups don't do this, instead they generate and post something called a zero-knowledge (or ZK, hence the name *ZK* rollup) proof to the underlying chain, which is a mathematical proof that the posted transaction data is valid, that can be verified without needing to know what exactly the full transaction data was.

ZK rollups are more secure than optimistic rollups, since they don't need to rely on peer attestation to determine validity, but they're computationally intensive since generating the ZK proof is hard, *and it's hard to make them compatible with Ethereum's dapps.*

The last italicised part is the important bit, because the entire point of Ethereum (and Polygon Matic, since Polygon Matic originated as an Ethereum side chain) is to have users be able to deploy decentralised applications to the Ethereum blockchain, but ZK rollups aren't compatible with dapps (*yet*, there are ZK rollups in the works that are supposedly compatible with dapps).

And that is why I said ""but actually no"". *Because* Loopring is a ZK rollup, it cannot support dapps like Polygon Matic can. Hence, it's not even a competitor to Polygon Matic. So, what is it? Well, it's basically a dex built directly into a ZK rollup. So, it's more correct to compare it to a Polygon-Matic-powered Uniswap, than it is to compare it to Polygon Matic itself. *However*, it *is* correct to compare Polygon Matic to *optimistic* rollups (of which Arbitrum is a good competitor to Polygon Matic), as well as the upcoming general-purpose dapp-compatible ZK rollups (StarkNet being the big one).

If you want more info on rollups as a whole, then I'd highly recommend these resources:
- [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/), for an overview of all currently available rollups.
- [L2Fees](https://l2fees.info/), to compare gas fees between rollups.
- ['ROLLUPS - The Ultimate Ethereum Scaling Strategy? Arbitrum &amp; Optimism Explained' by Finematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgCgauWVTs0), as a video guide that explains rollups in probably a better way than I did.",1635864932,hj0no0l

It will be rolled out for new releases as well and bake the process into content right from 1st point of sale.

Umm I'll see if I can find it again. I don't want to say without certainty but it sounded like founder has been working on it since he made loopring 10 years ago. I just happen to think IF they did partner with gamestop and that 2B dollars cash on hand with gamestop building that nft team.. might see something sooner rather than later. I'm also not here trying to time quick pumps like shiba and stuff so take it with a grain of salt. I'll pass to my kids if I have to,1635893858,hj2ozbd

Post Update - 03/11/2021

  
**LRC, NFT’s and Why People Are Talking About GameStop?**  
  
I wrote the last two posts on Loopring, which seemed to help and educate a lot of people on their potential partnership with some large companies.  
  
I wanted to talk about why Loopring and NFT’s are being linked to GameStop.  
What is GameStop?  
  
If you don’t follow the news or anything financial, GameStop is a company which sells video games, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer. For a while, GameStop had (and continues) to have a lot of selling pressure by large companies who wanted to see it crash, so they could gain financially. However, the loyalty of its customer base and shareholders has prevented this, and have turn the hooks on companies which shorted it. It has defied anyone who has gone against it, and is continuing to grow. It has also made a lot of people a lot of money who hold the shares.   
  
It has a true following which is loyal and unlike any other company around, and people are willing to keep buying it to watch it succeed. This is what we call a golden supporter base. Apple has it with its products. Samsung with there’s. GameStop has the same thing.   
  
**Why is GameStop getting into NFT’s?**   
  
A NFT is a single asset usually embedded in an object (like a video game skin, for example) and registered in a blockchain network. It is an encrypted digital record of a piece of art that can be bought, sold, and collected. NFTs, meanwhile, have been on their own popularity surge as everyone from traditional auction houses to billionaires began selling the unique digital collectibles.   
  
GameStop announced they would enter the NTF arena, to a great uproar from customers and shareholders. This was further enhanced by them launching a NFT website: htps://nft.gamestop.com/   
  
GameStop will be launching its platform on the Ethereum marketplace. The NFT marketplace is expected to reach 1-2 trillion dollars in sales in the next few years. With GameStop at the heart of the gaming industry, it has the ability to capture a large part of the gaming market with its NFT’s. With large gaming companies, and large movie producers looking for a industry leading platform to sell their NFT’s, GameStop would be the perfect place for them to get exposure, whilst increasing their revenue through there NFT marketplace.  
  
**So Why are GME Holders So Excited and Buying Up Loopring?**  
  
The Head of GameStop’s Blockchain is Matthew Finestone. The reason why many are getting excited is that he was Head of Business for Loopring before moving to GameStop. He was responsible for bringing business to Loopring, whilst onboarding other companies onto the Loopring system. One can assume that if GameStop needs a reliable, secure, and fast platform, then they would ask their Head of Blockchain where to go. In this case, it could potentially be Loopring. After all, Matthew Finestone did work for the company. He would potentially know everything he needs to know about the Loopring platform, and could integrate both companies together quite easily.   
  
Furthermore, GameStop is building a team of engineers, designers, gamers, and marketers to really create a NFT platform which is next generational, and the best in the industry.   
  
This along with Ryan Cohen who is known for launching and turning around businesses to make them reach new levels, meaning that backing Loopring and GameStop on a potential partnership could be rewarding for holders.   
  
**So, What Does This Mean for Loopring?**   
  
Loopring (before any rumours of GME came out) have stated they are going to be launching a free wallet (maybe this wallet can be provided to all users of the potential GME platform). They also stated that a big announcement is coming in Q4 which would be worth 10 times more than any announcement/quarterly report they would announce. **Possible rumours include Ubisoft.**  
  
This along with rumours that are working with an established partner who is building atop our newly released L2 NFT functionality, is why GME and Loopring holders are pretty excited to see what happens.  
  
  
**I hope it helps to why people keep linking GME and Loopring together. If this partnership is real, then you are linking a viral powerhouse with GME (who’s holders actually care about the company passionately), and Loopring (who has a game changing NFT platform to scale any company), which can cause an immediate impact to the global NFT marketplace.**",1635932692,hj4n0r7
"No. You have to buy loopring is what they're saying. 

No time to look shit up mate. Get in! We're going to the fucking moon.",1635932535,hj4mu2k
"Scaring each month is how I do it too.

So there's three options of stuff that can happen in November:

A) Gme announces that they have no collaboration with loopring
=&gt; You're fucked. Rip. Probably still a good long term hold but yikes 

B) Gme announces their marketplace on loopring
=&gt;You're probably not going to be able to buy more, but at least you made tons of profit.

C) GME stays silent
=&gt; Price likely dips to below 1$. You can DCA in December and buy a lot more loops. This is the best possible outcome.",1635932438,hj4mpvw

The ones I chose were ones I researched. If I don't believe in the project even if I see the potential, I won't invest (e.g. Loopring).

You'll see a lot of mentions and shills of coins, and your FOMO will kick in. But just because a comment says 'People are sleeping on x coin' and it has 5 upvotes, that's not a reason to jump in. Do your own research and due diligence. And don't kick yourself for missing out on a moon. 

As long as you're only investing what you can afford to lose, there's nothing wrong with learning from experience. Buy a few coins, that will give you the motivation to learn more about crypto in general and you'll eventually settle on your 10 coins and can course correct based on your increased knowledge.",1635925206,hj4eojn

"So, based on my understanding, when you move your assets into an L2, you're essentially locking them up within a smart contract. This smart contract is still on the L1, but your assets are held within the smart contract, and hence aren't directly accessible on the L1.

However, because they're held within a smart contract that exists on the L1, it's possible to withdraw your assets to the L1, directly from the L1, by requesting a withdrawal from the smart contract through a special L1 transaction sent to the smart contract.

The smart contract obviously needs to be designed with L1 withdrawals in mind, but Loopring is, and this L1 withdrawal is a major selling point of ZK rollups, so I'd imagine that other ZK rollups will develop their smart contracts with L1 withdrawals in mind.

This is very useful in case you moved your assets into a malicious L2 that is blocking your transactions, as they cannot block your transactions on the L1. You essentially retain the ability to forcefully pull your assets out of the L2, without needing to go through the L2.

From what I know about Loopring, L1 withdrawal from the L1 isn't cheap (you essentially need to provide proof that the assets your withdrawing are valid, and getting that proof costs a good amount of gas), but you have the option there, which is better than what side chains offer.

At the same time, though, Loopring offers an L1 withdrawal from within the L2, at a reduced cost due to the fact that the withdrawal is happening inside the L2. So, if you just want to move your funds back to the L1, then moving them back is very cheap if you do so through the L2.",1635911817,hj3v15t

yes this partnership is good news, but it's also common news. these type of partnerships happen all the time. there's no revolution here. anyone hyping otherwise is probably just a gme bagholder still chasing their get rich quick dreams that have been slowly dying over the past 10 months

"In business, there's a concept called a *moat*. This is basically an allegorical way of saying, ""let's say I build a castle, what stops my enemies from crossing my gates and taking what I have?""

Here's the sad thing about the state of the sub right now: everyone is concerned about price. If you look at certain projects, they are actually being used - or will be used - in droves. Their price is not really shooting for the moon (as more money will start hitting diminishing returns depending on who you are).

You want real use cases outside of the upper blue chips? Be warned, a lot are boring price-wise, but they're being used:

* UniSwap (the foundation allows forking of its liquidity-pool tech, and its token is for governance)
* Chainlink ([use cases blog](https://blog.chain.link/44-ways-to-enhance-your-smart-contract-with-chainlink/))
* Solana, Tezos (for NFT-minting alternatives)
* Polygon, Loopring (Layer-2 scaling solutions where you need to move stuff around with the coins)
* Mirror Protocol, Synthetix, Alchemix (for non-crypto-market trading, otherwise called 'mirrored' or 'synthetic' assets)
* Stellar Lumens (moving money around at low costs)
* Axie Infinity (you use the coin to get your Axie NFTs), and by extension, Smooth Love Potion and Sand
* Decentraland (for Facebook's / Meta's VR developments)
* Amp - used for collateral in transactions; Gemini offers this on their site
* Curve DAO, dYdX, [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance) and any of its ilk - wealth management tools
* Quant - used for enterprise blockchain solutions
* Basic Attention Token - advertisers pay you for your attention (neat change)
* Ren - liquidity exchange (most people can't use this though, since bonding to a darknode is about 10k-100k REN)

You are right though, in the sense that a lot of cool tech will fizzle out because their use case(s) will end, or they'll be made obsolescent. This is why it's important to pick the winners long-term and see how every coin performs short-term.

Consider, for example, how many individual blockchains are made for X or Y case. Consider how many of those are Ethereum-based. Now, consider if any of those blockchains will be re-made (if at all) on a new codebase taking advantage of Layer-0 systems like Polkadot or Cosmos (two very unique offerings in the market). Do any of the above coins have moats in the aforementioned description?

Remove the price tag from the coin and think about what the coin / token is transferring - money, data, votes? Then you can properly assess value.",1635999563,hj8svdm

"To clear some of these things up.

&gt;It's Layer 2 but also off-chain in the sense that it's sufficiently difficult to go back to Layer 1 without its servers.

Difficult is probably the right word. In the future, an easy to use GUI will make the escape hatch much easier to use.

&gt;And it uses a special wallet that's similarly off-chain

It's a smart contract wallet and it's on Loopring. Doesn't introduce any centralization.

&gt;Has very few nodes beyond its servers, assuming any exist at all

The whole idea of zk rollups is that you don't need a lot of nodes because they can't steal your funds anyway. The only reason to have more nodes is to guard against censorship or liveness failure.

"The Loopring cryptocurrency, LRC, is necessary for key operations on the protocol. 
For instance, anyone who wishes to operate a decentralized exchange on Loopring must lock up at least 250,000 LRC, which enables the operator to run an exchange that uses its on-chain data proofs. An operator must stake 1 million LRC to run an exchange without this feature. 
Further, LRC helps incentivize the proper use of the Loopring network. Exchange operators who deposit LRC could even have deposits confiscated by the protocol if they operate exchanges poorly. These confiscated funds would then be distributed to users who choose to lock up LRC.
Elsewhere, any user can stake LRC to earn a portion of trading fees paid to the protocol. 
Some 70% of fees are distributed to users who stake LRC. A further 20% is allocated to the Loopring Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which is designed to allow a pool of funds to be spent at the discretion of Loopring users in future. 
Finally, 10% of fees are burned. This means the total supply of LRC will decrease over time, putting pressure on its price. The total supply of LRC is capped at 1.395 million tokens. ",1636096939,hje040g
"Heres what I dont get - countless companies have built NFT platforms, just because a failing chain of shops for physical games are trying to revitalize by implementing a NFT marketplace on Loopring, how on earth are you expecting that to suddenly bring in enough traffic and value to justify the current price increase, when LRC is already being used by larger and more successful partners and thus already have had great growth this year?

Yeah - this is also a speculative bubble based on hopium, but dont people realise that after a week of shilling and ""leaks"" any televant price increase id already more then priced in, and thus you're destined to fall victim to a buy the rumor/sell the news situation if you try to HODL past the actual announcement?

I'm not saying LRC isnt a good project and GME might not be succesful in saving their business by building a NFT marketplace on top of it...

But I fail to see where any of that actually brings in any sort of substantial value to the network - and I fear that most people jumping on the bandwagon now are just buying the hopium, and will have to wait for something more substantial to happen on LRC before they will actually see a return on their investment...",1636096887,hje01xt

"Loopring is an L2 protocol. I saw others in this thread talking as if Loopring tech was a figure of imagination… Yet Loopring has been a layer 2 implementation for years now. Cost of entry is expensive, but once in, you’re living the life of low fees - look into Loopring’s DEX and wallet if you’re actually interested in that.  

For real though, it’s always kind of crazy coming into this sub and seeing people constantly whine about GAS fees (which is justified in all fairness), while failing to even comprehend that there are L2 solutions out there with minimal fees. Hit up /r/ethfinance - a good chunk of us have been into crypto for a long time now, and a good chunk of us are using L2 solutions like Loopring for trading. 

With that said, I almost find it comical for these gme “apes” to preach LRC because they see the word ‘Loopring’. Fallacy here is that they think Loopring protocol/tech = LRC token usage. Apes might be able to pump lrc because of the word association, but they fail to realize that lrc essentially has nothinggg to do with Loopring tech. Hence I laugh at their “DD’s” purporting that Loopring protocol integration = LRC gains. Because the equation makes no sense hah. 

I’ve been preaching this reality since lrc started getting shilled on here. It’s frustrating to see the false equivalencies between Loopring protocol and lrc. It’s frustrating to see that people in this very comment section don’t even realize Loopring L2 already exists. My voice doesn’t matter though, these people preach loud enough and they can directly affect price. Allll I gotta say to that is that price will not be able to hold because of what they say. Lrc is an essentially useless token at this point - buying &amp; holding does nothing for the protocol - and it’ll drop off in price because of that (just as it was before the GME people started associating lrc with Loopring tech). 

But to play devil advocate on myself… GME loonies will find a way to vocalize lrc (no matter how irrelevant it may to be Loopring protocol) once the gme NFT market comes online. So I’m not giving financial advice here, I’m just pointing out the mere fact the lrc has 0 utility in what the “apes” are pushing, and that’s what’s most frustrating to see. They don’t understand tokenomics… and they look at tokens as if they’re shares in a company… and they couldn’t be more incorrect in that line of thinking.",1636090327,hjds040

"Yes it’s a layer 2. Few neat things, 1) all your value is stored on the base chain (eth) so if loopring magically disappeared you just go to the ethereum chain and eject your value (most “layer 2s” are side chains and can’t claim that). 2) looprings counterfactual wallets coming out in the next couple of days to a week will allow your fiat/coins directly to layer 2 avoiding going through layer 1 at all, which means no gas fees.

On the topic of gas fees; I mean, as much as everyone complains about gas fees, eth 2.0 is not going to fix that. Loopring is legit going to save everyone massive amounts of money in gas fees. It will allow for token swaps for free/minimal fees and access to the whole ethereum ecosystem.

Also, you can mint, store, and send NFTs for super cheap too.

Not to mention their smart wallet solves the security without the need to store keys as a tattoo on your ass. Let’s be real, your ol’ granny is not gunna know wtf keys are and that’s holding back adoption.",1636067349,hjchjnv

Is this now a personality trait? That whole GME saga is the QAnon of the investment world. Now this shit spills over into crypto. It's the same template. We get bombarded with QDrop like announcements. For example the mysterious announcement on twitter or the sole developer from Loopring who switched to GameStop or the leak from the source code. Even if true, it's probably just some joke from a dev who enriches himself on the stupidity of others. Your post and the comments alike are just grasping at any straws. No technical analysis of any sort. Why is there no audit of looping from a reputable company? People who actually try to interact with LRC and are disappointed about the process get downvoted on the LRC sub. I was in for the ride and dumped it. I wish you all good luck with the gamble.

"People on this sub and investing in general are like goldfish and think things will happen overnight. SHIB and DOGE took a long time to pump and there were several signs they'd eventually pump. DOGE was Elon and his cult following - Elon tweeted about it last year before it rocketed like 300% IIRC. SHIB was the mysterious buyer that dumped millions to buy it a month or so before it rocketed. The number of spammers and shills that came out for SHIB was intense. 

Loopring has the potential for it's connection to GME with r/Superstonk, r/wallstreetbets, and r/CryptoCurrency picking it up for their millions of members. It wouldn't surprise me to see it pump in 3-4 months once whales buy enough to manipulate market price. It also wouldn't surprise me to see Harmony One eventually pump in 2-3 months after it's shilling here for the past month.",1636066054,hjceguk

"Completely out of context. Guy didn’t even read what Loopring update actually did. Wow. 

Basically to get the Coins from Coinbase to LRC counterfactual wallet you need to transfer from L1 to L2. Well Coinbase is L1. Loopring already has a wallet that lets you transfer from L1 to L2 but it’s not free. The counterfactual wallet was added to transfer L2- to L2 at a minimum fee. Once the normal wallet is free (which it will be in the future) then we are able to move from L1 to L1 without buying the “normal wallet”

"Well you’re making a lot of assumptions and determining outcomes as fact. The market typically does a better job figuring out these answers than one person. That includes me, but I can take a stab at you’re very specific scenarios. 

1.	I’d assume DRM would be handled at the blockchain obviously. We currently can verify ownership of NFTs by wallet; I’m sure it’d be similar. Or they’d develop a layer 2 like loopring??? Who knows but just because you can’t foresee a solution doesn’t mean others haven’t or can’t. 
2.	there are already solutions for file sharing, you need only seek it out. IPFS for instance could hold the game and the NFT could be the “key”. 

So… yeah.",1640117463,hpgspaw

"From their [post](https://medium.loopring.io/introducing-l2-counterfactual-wallet-and-fiat-on-ramps-a4b60edf15d6) this morning:
&gt; The L1 + L2 Wallet is not a ‘normal’ Ethereum address, it is a smart contract. As such, it is much more flexible, and has rules and logic baked in, which makes it much more user-friendly and secure. L1 Smart Wallet security features include guardians, setting daily limits, whitelisting trusted addresses, and locking it down if ever needed. The guardians allow for extreme peace of mind knowing you have the ability to recover your wallet and funds if it’s ever lost, stolen or deleted.
 &gt;The Counterfactual Wallet (L2 only) gives you more of a basic security option. If your phone is ever stolen, lost or deleted, you are trusting the Official Loopring Guardian to recover your wallet. When recovering the Counterfactual Wallet, the smart contract must be created on L1 ultimately incurring a gas fee for the user.",1640115888,hpgopbm

If you pay for the full wallet, you can move your crypto from L1-L2 for free. Personally I’m not going to be using it until there is a fiat off-ramp (which is incoming). Then there won’t be a reason to use L1 anymore. Currently has for Loopring L2 is 18 cents. This is how ETH becomes cheap to use, and the first true ZKRollup is here.

&gt;With the release of our Counterfactual Wallet, users can now deploy the Wallet on L2-only, bypassing a costly creation fee on L1.

&gt;The Counterfactual Wallet harnesses the massive scalability boost (100x cheaper fees), that comes with a zk-baked wallet. While zkRollups promise much of the same security guarantees as Ethereum, this Counterfactual Wallet is more of an introductory wallet, and does not include the limitless extensibility and security features compared to the full (L1+L2) Smart Wallet.

A few things for me:

* It was early days and Gamestop appear to be using it. Adoption by a large corporation is a hugely positive sign for an early coin.
* The tech itself sounds like it solves two problems: easy NFT's (not my thing but that's not terribly relevant) and ETH gas fees
* I had some underperforming coins so was looking for something better
* Had actually come across loopring, thought it looked interesting but was busy so didn't buy, came across it independently about 2 weeks later so threw a few quid at it
* My risk tolerance is reasonably high

It had pumped a fair bit before I got in tbh. Initial buy in around $1.10. Averaged now to about 1.75.

"I sorted by new and spent time reading comments on posts. Found out about LRC last week. Their big Gamestop announcement hasn't even happened yet, so if you don't know about LRC then go check it out.   


Here are some highlights you can verify on your own.  


One of the former heads of Loopring is now head of Blockchain at Gamestop.  
Gamestop has talked about an NFC marketplace and is actively hiring crypt and app developers.  
Loopring has said that they are currently working with one major partner and it will be announced Q4 this year.  
Github code from loop ring shows connections to Gamestop NFT Urls and Gamestops verified wallet.   


Yesterday the chair of Gamestop asked if he should Hold or Hodl his gamestop shares. Some imply this means Hold on the Stock Market, or Hodl in Crypto.  
There was also a tweet from Gamestop saying they were finalizing some details before ""Putting a Ring on It""  
The founder of Loopring tweeted ""This could be your wealth code"" like it could be your cheat code to wealth in response to Greyscale adding loopring to assets to consider.   


Vitalik said Loopring was a key to the future of Eth because of ZKRollups.

Gamestop short squeezers are just starting to find their way to Loopring. Many have never done crypto before.   


So this could be a perfect storm of:  
Utility to address as fees on the Eth network  
Meme because of all the crazy Game Stop Apes  
National Press due to what the apes have done already to gamestop  
and a household name that even my boomer parents know.

The nail in the coffin for me to start buying heavy was when I watched Vitalik talk with Lex Freidman about layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, as eth gas fees are very high rn.  He went through the two scaling methods of sharding vs ZK rollup.  LRC utilizes ZK rollup, and Vitalik mentioned Loopring by name as a great solution to ETH scaling.

"Call me crazy I guess but I don't think Loopring or VET are anywhere near their peak yet. There's been a pump, sure, but these are small for the growth potential they both have, LRC in particular. If you're going to start buying *today* wouldn't be wrong to get either.",1636490719,hjzcscf

All I'm saying above is that Reddit is really fine with **providing** the information, you just have to use it properly. 

For me though, i use the product itself. Like, if I like Loopring - Actually go and use Loopring. See if you like what it does.  Is it a good user experience? Do you like how it feels? 

This is one of the reasons I originally sold Augur, and bought MANA. I HATED how Augur felt to use, and MANA was not really my thing, but I could understand why people would like using it.",1636490599,hjzchfc
"I just traded my Cardano for it, and will likely throw even more behind that.

Loopring is a protocol for settling ethereum transactions in bulk, off-chain by what's known as a zkRollup (self-knowledge rollup). The transactions are done on layer 2, and the transaction information is passed back down to layer 1. So the transaction doesn't incur the high gas fees and long waits of layer 1. This means loopring process a lot of transactions quickly and efficiently. It can settle 2,025 transactions per second. The efficiencies permit them to charge consistent, nominal fees (think .25%). It also allows for efficient minting of NFT's on layer 2, which have historically been a menace throughout the gas crunch. But my favorite part is that it will (I hope) make non-custodial exchanges not only practical but competitive and efficient.

This is incredibly promising for adoption. It permits parties of any scale or description to transact on the Ethereum network efficiently and for a low, predictable cost. I imagine businesses of all types are looking for precisely that.

Also, Vitalik likes it and has talked up zkRollups quite a bit.

I'm probably going to shovel money into this one",1636490490,hjzc7cp

Would likely moon would likely dump 

Either way if i see a coin get pumped so easy because gme MIGHT pump that one .. i dont see how ours wont. 

I think reddit could put some of their own cash in to make it moon so people FOMO in.

I mean we agree on it having very little use... but comparing it to loopring currently is a fair comparison to make imho

Shib and so on not so much because reddit doesnt deploy fake accounts and bots.

However if reddit wants to be mean they can shut down all the paid crypto adverts on their site and replace that with moons.

So in general yes it is a pretty good coin to hold.

They may be able to carve out their own niche within the market, maybe offering dirt cheap swaps since their rollup is built specifically for swaps, along with integration into their NFT minting services and such, all connected via Hop (so you can send tokens from, say, Arbitrum or StarkNet directly to Loopring via Hop, without touching the L1 network), but general use will probably move to general-purpose ZK rollups.",1636520867,hk17pqk

Loopring protocol is a beautiful piece of tech that allows for pure defi usability. Beauty of the tech soley lies within the protocol, of which lrc the token has nothing to do with.

To go into more details : there are 2 kinds of layer-2 rollups, optimistic and Zero-Knowledge (ZK). ZK is favoured as it is faster and less vulnerable to certain attacks. 

Loopring is a ZK-rollup network. Other ZK-rollup competitors are Starkware, zkSync, Aztec, Polygon Hermez chain, or zktube. I think most of these are wallet apps and don't necessarily have their own coins.",1636511889,hk0q2no

"All of the alternatives you listed are side chains, they are entirely separate blockchains that are secured with their own consensus mechanism, that just support the EVM and allow assets to be moved between them and Ethereum via their bridges. Any assets that exist on a side chain are secured by that side chain.

Loopring is a rollup, it's a set of smart contracts that exist on the Ethereum chain, that handle transaction execution off chain within an external system, but will post transaction data in a compressed form on chain. Any assets that exist within a rollup are secured by Ethereum, not the rollup.

Even Polygon knows this, which is why they've acquired Hermez, another rollup developer, and have been working on their own rollup, Polygon Hermez. In the future, side chains will primarily be used to bridge two different blockchains (Ethereum and Cardano, Ethereum and Algorand, Cardano and Tezos, etc), while scalability will be left to rollups, because rollups simply do a better job at scaling a blockchain, while leaving security to the blockchain being scaled by the rollup.",1636510562,hk0n2yh

"On behalf of all looptroops, I wanna say sorry for what our looptards did a few days ago. There is a lot of good fundamentals about Loopring (LRC) so there is no need for mindless shilling. Here are the things I personally like:

* ETH L2. 2022 is gonna be the year of L2s.
* It's a ZK rollup. Fast and secure (inherits security guarantees of L1), state of the art, high TPS.
* They are working on a general purpose zk EVM. There is currently a race to see who is gonna bring the first zk EVM to market.
* LRC is low market cap (room for growth) with high circulation (less risk to get dumped on).
* It supports NFTs and is rumored to be the partner for GameStop upcoming NFT platform. Rumored to launch Q4.
* Great community (when not too excited).
* Price is a great entry right now (30% down from ATH, in accumulation phase like it did last week).

What else did I miss?",1636826165,hkhbrb7
"If the GameStop and Loopring partnership is true, what kind of NFT marketplace do you think they both are building? 

Personally, I would love for them to come up with a way to introduce ownership of digital copies of games via NFTs. Be a great way to introduce a new revenue stream for both GameStop and publishers while at the same time allowing consumers to sell their digital games for money.",1636825908,hkhb5jm

LRC.  I would buy EVEN MORE Loopring.  Do you not remember GME?  I just have this gut feeling it’s going to be the next coin to pump from it’s current lowly position to a top ten market cap in what seems like the blink of an eye (like Doge or Shib but actually useful).  To me $1000 is worth a ridiculous moonshot gamble.  It isn’t much money so your best shot is something with massive potential for return.  A 20% gain on $1000 likely isn’t going to mean shit to you.  Worst case scenario how badly could losing 40-50% possibly set you back?  A week?  Best case scenario you end up with a portfolio worth twenty times what you paid for it a year from now.,1636226493,hjl38v4

So again my logic is that Etheruem emerges as the dominant blockchain/smart contract platform - and that a handful of Layer 2 protocols work to reduce the gas fees for users - I'm picking Loopring to emerge as the winner of that battle.

This thing will get huge)

But even if I’m bullish on IOTA, I clearly see that it will be able to coexist with Ethereum, and the gas fees are killing ETH at the moment. Therefore investing in a couple of L2 solutions are smart. The tech is needed.
Therefore i have invested in loopring but also made a bet on another L2 scaling solution, Nahmii, at a much lower micro marketcap. Who knows? What if Nahmii have developed a better L2 solution? If so it’s jackpot for me.

Nano as well is a great project. The transactions are super fast. And for fun I also have Banano.. just imagine what will happen if the meme market get the interest in DAG tech? Then Banano will be the choice for many.

It’s a wallet I can see my parents using is what I mean, not that it’s the best most secure option in the world.

Unlike sidechains like Matic, all your Eth-based assets just sit in an Eth contract. This is important, because if the (yes, centralized) relayer goes down, you can still retrieve your funds. When you perform actions on loopring, those get compressed into a very small proof that proves the validity of all the changes without needing to know each individual step itself.

ZK Rollups are actually insane, and you should learn a bit about them. The relayer role can be decentralized over time, but doesn't really add any security to the system... It just prevents downtime.",1635885099,hj22jwp

Some L2s do support smart contracts, but not all of them, as far as I can tell loopring is one that does not",1635883787,hj1z4u0

"I really have liked the project for quite some time (before GME). The GME saga is a big deal, and the sheer buying power associated with it I believe will cause Loopring to skyrocket out of rumor fomo. However, I think this is not just a pump, I think people are going to see that it’s a cool project and they will come for the fomo, stay for the after party. Honestly, I think it’s a great thing for crypto as a whole.",1635883717,hj1yygl

"While it is possible for zk rollups to support smart contracts, indeed. Not all zk rollup solutions are the same. Because you said I was missing something I decided to take a closer look through the Loopring white paper as I was curious if they had full EVM support or require a custom language like zkSync. However, I could not find any information in the white paper, or their site about their smart contract support. Infact in the white paper I found this description of loopring:

""Loopring is not a DEX, but a modular protocol for building
DEXs on multiple blockchains. We disassemble the component parts of a traditional exchange and offer a set of public smart contracts and decentralized actors in its place.""

This sounds a lot like Loopring is infact, not a general purpose L2 but one with very specific goals and only designed to allow for the building of one very specific application type, DEX's. So it does not look like I missed anything at all. If I have, which you are so adamant, please link me to some information on their EVM compatibility or smart contract support.

BTW here is the link to the white paper:

It’d be a way to pay the artist and the supporters. Like I said I think nfts have a use case but not so much with art.

"&gt; They are going to bring the rumours down

So you think the rumours are untrue? Loopring literally just mentiones Gamestop in their code for no reason whatsoever? The head of blockchain at Gamestop is not a former loopring employee too? And GME wasn't looking for employees specifically with L2 experience?

Meanwhile LRC announced they'll have a premium partner for an NFT marketplace in Q4, and gamestop is said to announce their NFT marketplace in, coincidentally, Q4 as well? 

There are obviously some realistic scenarios in which this doesn't skyrocket LRC price(for example if GME announces an NFT marketplace on multiple sidechains and L2s), but there's almost no way there isn't an actual partnership.",1636051996,hjbf9fb

By external I mean: you suddenly hear of Algo or Loopring and that changes your strategy because you get hyped ever so slightly or you fear of missing out.

What I would do is:
1. Keep the position in ADA
2. DCA new money into Algo and Loopring.

"Still very new to crypto.

I bought some Loopring a few days back and decided I wanted to take out my original investment after it 2.5x but couldn't exchange using Changelly as I didn't have enough ETH in my wallet. Er, sorry?

Upon further investigation Loopring is a ERC20 coin (of which I wasn't aware) so now I need to buy some ETH to pay for the cost of converting LRC into something else.

My question is (and I think I already know the answer) do I need to buy twice as much ETH to cover the initial purchase AND the conversion? I'd hate to buy the $60 of ETH needed to convert LRC just to find that $60 has been used up in the purchase of ETH and there's nothing left for the conversion.",1636050244,hjbasoz

"Technically looking, Loopring remains in a buy zone still, if you decide to buy this cryptocurrency in November 2021, you should use a “stop-loss” order because the risk remains high .

Genuine hypothetical - say loopring fizzles and nothing happens.  I believe the gaming NFT space is going to be huge.  Who’s likely to succeed if not Loopring? ENJ? MANA? A new coin?  I’d love to hear what people are thinking.  Shill me!,1636396878,hju2kqp

"Loopring hasn't gone parabolic yet though. Yeah it went up 3x because some rumors came out, but the market cap is still super small at $2.4 billion.

For comparison, shib is around $30 billion right now. So even if LRC 10x it would still be significantly less market cap than shib, not to mention the cap of all the $50+ billion coins in the top 10. Basically, still tons of room for growth.",1636396702,hju24wf
Loopring,1636396527,hju1p10

DCIP Is going places. I have a ton of money in Loopring and in ethereum but is sold some last night to get some DCIP,1636396237,hju0yqy
"Hard to say, I've educated myself over the last few years. Spent hours and hours and hours all day and night every day watching charts or doing research on redditor wherever. That is when I'm not working or doing anything

I have bought a few signal groups of which the first one was actually the best one. They have a app also if you'd like to check it out.( Signals - crypto it's called zyncas studio) I don't do them manually anymore but have a trading bot running on these signals. They are not always right but definitely make more profits than losses and in the end that's what it's about. Bought some others but those seem more p&amp;d and a random lucky correct signal.

But my main gains are produced by myself. For instance last Friday or around then I read somewhere on wallstreetbets about gamestop and loopring. Spend hours finding out all I could about lrc. Sold everything I had freely in my spot wallet and converted it into lrc at around 1.29$. Chart looked magnificent and today it went all the way to 1.85$. 

Even with futures trading I've been doing quite well. It wasn't like that when I started. To greedy and to much leverage. Made a lot of losses. But this turned around completely.  TA is definitely not complete bullshit otherwise I'd be broke as f*ck by now.

In the end I think it's a bit of luck, a lot of time and research. Experience and motivation. Know your limits and when needed cut your losses.
What's the point in holding coins that keep devaluing. 
It's not all fun and games. Can be very depressing if you are losing or the market is going the other way",1636396183,hju0tuy
What is difference between Loopring and Polygon (Matic)? Both layer2 right?,1636396155,hju0rbg
Should be replaced by Loopring,1636396143,hju0q7d
"I don’t have tons of money in this, just started out in crypto. Some guy made a post a few weeks ago about loopring so I bought in at like 40 cents. Taking me everything I have not to cash out. I see some people saying it could go to $5 or $10. It’s not even crazy profits, but it’s my profit and I want it now!",1636395945,hju08jo
Loopring fixes this,1636395929,hju072w
I think LRC Loopring is about to have another explosion,1636395890,hju03ky
"Lol same, I have been buying only BTC and ETH for 2 years. Last week was my first detour, trading some of my stash for some Loopring. Like you said, it made too much sense.

Edit: typo",1636395683,hjtzl4o
Seriously can’t you just remove these Loopring-apes allready?,1636395070,hjty3so

Isnt SOL hype taking a backseat tho? Loopring,1636394844,hjtxmo5
"Red-pilled w/ LRC:

\- Serious project (really, it's a ZKRollup Ethereum solution to bring down ETH gas fees) and they have a working solution right now

\- GME working on an NFT project using Loopring as the underlying technology: this brings r/wsb and r/superstonks degens into it

\- MarketCap 2B$ (if SHIB being a pure memecoin without any fundamentals got to 40B$, you can see it is not too late)

\- Fully dilluted supply = Circulatin supply. This is a key concept many people ignore, no new tokens will come into circulation that dilute the price

\- Listed in every centralized exchange. Easy access by retail, no need to use decentralized exchangse or dark websites to buy it

NFA, I have some bags of LRC after writing up this thesis",1636394571,hjtwykf
Loopring,1636394531,hjtwuym
"LRC enters the chat. 

Seriously though: Read a bit about Layer 2 chains. It's basically batch processing in simple terms for ETH and loopring is one of the most popular ones which was also endorsed by Buterin (ETH founder) in a youtube video. It aims to make Eth transfers pretty much gas-less",1636394392,hjtwial
"The fact that you aren’t seeing tons of YouTube videos with bold price predictions and big emojis about Loopring. 
This tells you we are so early even the crypto nerds on YouTube aren’t on to it yet. 

These are ppl that live for click bait and making a video about literally anything involving crypto for likes. 

Right now there is like 4 super low quality videos made. 

Just wait till those degens get ahold of it",1636394289,hjtw91p
Sorry was thinking it was still censored! But loopring,1636394264,hjtw6ri

When it shits itself and the hopium is gone, this sub will somehow get the blame for it. There was a time when other alts were censored because there really wasn’t a balance in this sub anymore. The way it’s shilled really just becomes noise imo. It has the opposite effect on people. The quality of this sub tanks.",1636392444,hjtrlih

"**MOST Discussed Cryptocurrencies on /r/CryptoCurrency (3/11/21):**

    1. Ethereum (2721 Mentions).
    2. Loopring (1937 Mentions).
    3. Bitcoin (1491 Mentions).
    4. Cardano (842 Mentions).
    5. PolkaDot (671 Mentions).

**Biggest Changes:**

-	ETH retains the top spot for the second day in a row now, extending its lead and breaking the mythical 2500+ mentions barrier, which few coins have ever done. 
-	Other big news includes LRC, which has moved up into 2nd place today. Usually the top 2 spots are always occupied by BTC and ETH, so any other coin needs to put in some serious work in mentions/discussions to break this.
-	New entrants into the chart include DOT, which saw a 133% increase in mentions in the past day, pushing DOGE into 6th place.
-	Special mentions also go out to TRAC (8th place), which saw a whopping 1033% increase in mentions over the past day and SOL (7th place), which saw a 150%+ increase in mentions.

If you zoom out in the chart you see that loopring was in the Bullrun before this one. I’m pretty sure there are some  baghodlers that went down with the ship. They probably can’t wait to sell their bags to get their money back. So basically you are now fighting old bag hodlers + trying to make a project moon.  Statistically new projects without any Bullrun experience will have a more powerful pump. Of course no ones selling at this point but you got to reach $2.50 before there is any price discovery going. Not saying it can’t happen but there are some obstacles that need to be sorted + the rumor being true + the whole nft running before you might see the real value of the project. Also nothing pumps forever they need to cooldown and consolidate before continuing if that is the case.,1635973558,hj77grc

"Wallet creation is launching on Arbitrum. It’s there on the site as ‘coming soon’. I’d also expect it on StarkNet and/or zkSync which will massively reduce that initial fee.

I can see where you’re coming from when you perceive it as a CEX. L2 fiat on-ramps is confirmed as a feature. But would that still be your view when the cost of full Wallet creation is negligible? It’s accepted that the bulk of Eth activity will live on native Layer 2 solutions, so it’s difficult to reconcile Ethereum as being the home of Defi whilst characterising Loopring as a CEX.

Btw. I’d discourage anyone from purchasing the mobile wallet until it is affordable.",1635970625,hj6zr9v

"OP is enthusiastic but he's not great at explaining the underlying technical reasons this is the case. 

Basically, Loopring is a zkrollup L2 living on Ethereum's L1 in the form of a smart contract. You bridge your assets to this contract, and then they are essentially replicated on Loopring's network. That's why it costs initial gas- you're transferring tokens to a smart contract on ETH mainnet. 

Once your assets are on Loopring, you can do as many transactions as you like and LR will bundle them, perform ZK computations, and post the proof to mainnet for much less gas than performing those transactions on L1. They pay for this gas with trading fees on the LR DEX. Transfers between addresses are free, however. 

Should you wish to withdraw your assets from Loopring (or any zkrollup) *at any time, no matter what* you can do so entirely from L1 if you wish. As long as Ethereum exists, your assets are safe in the L1 smart contract. Loopring can't steal them, and if their HQ is hit by an asteroid you can still retrieve your assets. 

The LRC token, on the other hand, would probably go bust if Loopring goes down. But that's not the same as actually having your funds stolen.",1635862262,hj0hesa

You own Loopring but you have not set up your wallet yet on L2

"&gt; This seems centralized. You can only use their wallet, right?

Correct. However, because it is a zkrollup centralization is not as much of a concern like it is with L1s. If Loopring goes down, you can still retrieve your funds from the Ethereum Mainnet smart contract bridge. At most I believe they can prevent you from transacting on the L2 (if they hate you for some reason) but you can always withdraw your funds, even if Loopring HQ gets hit by an asteroid. 

&gt; I downloaded their wallet and have to pay $150 to create a new wallet? This is new to me. What’s that about?

Creating an Loopring wallet involves transacting with Ethereum mainnet, which factors into the fees required for initial setup and bridging. 

&gt; It seems like you would still get charged gas fees from the dex you’re using?

It might be a technicality, but their main claim to fame is that there are no *gas* fees for trades or transfers, which is true. There are trading fees, however, which go to liquidity providers on the DEX and I think a small cut which goes to the protocol so it can pay gas fees to post zk proofs on ETH mainnet.

It was incredibly hard to find an actual description for loopring, which is a huge red flag. Shilling is everywhere.

"I don't use Loopring and the only LRC I own is what Coinbase gave me for filling out the quiz, so I'm not trying to shill it here. 

Spamming - Loopring charges a small fee for trades, which reduces trade spam. They also charge for creating an account. They do not appear to charge for transfers, so I'm not sure how they mitigate spam that way. They might not be close enough to their capacity limit to care right now. 

Entry fee - It used to be free but I think there is one now, but it's smaller than the gas fee for initially bridging assets into LRC. There are also withdrawal fees for bridging assets back to mainnet. Not sure what those fees are since I think it depends on ETH mainnet gas fees. You can actually pay this fee in a few different tokens, including DAI and USDC. 

Move your funds off chain? - In actuality you don't do this. You move your funds on ETH mainnet to the Loopring smart contract, and your funds are then mapped to your address/account on Loopring's zkrollup network. 

Centralized? - Yes, but with zkrollups *it doesn't matter as much*. If Loopring goes down, you can still get your funds out of the ETH mainnet smart contract. As long as Ethereum exists, your funds on zkrollups are safe. At most they *might* be able to censor your transactions on Loopring by blocking your address from submitting transactions to the L2, but you'll still be able to withdraw your funds from the network.

From the article:


While the leak falls into the category of unconfirmed rumor, GameStop Due Diligence adds the firm isn’t one for “splashy public reveals,” and will likely announce the project once it’s completed.

“It is likely that GameStop will not make any splashy public reveals about GameStop NFT until the offering is finalized.”
What’s more, the start of this week saw GameStop post eight remote positions. Three relate to NFT marketing, another three for NFT software engineers, and the final two for Web3 gaming.

Web3 gaming hints at plans to develop virtual gaming, perhaps in a metaverse setting and bridging with NFTs. The job description talks about building products from scratch and requires experience with Ethereum.

“Have you built products from scratch? Have you launched new initiatives and grown them to billions in revenue? Have you dabbled in the new Web3 world? Are you a gamer to your core? If so, you belong here with us.”",1635804331,hixrnl9
"Polygon just gained in popularity early in the year when gas fees were insane and there was no clear competitor.

They use a different layer 2 system that is less secure and more expensive than a zkrollup.

They actually invested 1 billion recently into researching zkrollups.

This gives loopring a 3 year advantage in the tech .

Polygon just had alot of hype and a decent ecosystem.

Loopring doesn't have the same ecosystem but has the better tech - if that makes sense.

With this partnership and the original meme crowd (GME) 

They are gonna be on the map.

Top 50 coin atleast imho.

Which would still make loop 4.50$ a coin 😎

Pretty bullish overall",1635804219,hixre5j
"He's lying - loopring has better tech than polygon.

Polygon just invested a billion dollars a few days ago to do what loopring has been working on for 3 years which are 
Zkrollups.

Even vitalik says it's a good project.",1635804059,hixr0ij
LRC Loopring. The apes are just getting started.,1635803803,hixqepb
"LRC, gamestop partnership incoming. It went parabolic today and is still ridiculously undervalued. When Gamestop announce their decentralised marketplace built upon Loopring I expect the price to skyrocket.",1635803733,hixq8p6
Loopring is mostly used to build Dex's on. Brilliant futur being the most secure layer 2 option on the Ethereum Blockchain with almost 0 fees!,1635803432,hixpiwv
LRC is loopring correct? Ive been looking into it for a while.,1635803269,hixp51w

"Remember how VET teased their partnership with DHL for days and got 25% up? Gamestop and Loopring partnership isn't even OFFICIAL YET (it's a leak) and LRC is up 133%. Gamestop hasn't even MENTIONED there's gonna be an NFT collection on their socials.

If you think you're too late, think again.

If you think you should sell, think again.",1635803120,hixoshr
"So why am I hearing about SAND, MANA, LOOPRING AFTER they have already pumped!!  Come on fellows - tell me the ones that are about to pump in advance..  I don't need much notice, but give me at least a few hours please!!

Let's work together to get us all Lambos!!",1635803072,hixood8
"I know everyone says not to margin trade but if you can look at the chart and kinda know what you're doing, and keep your risk balanced...it's freeeee monnnneyyyy to boost your bullish plays.

 Tried it on some Loopring today and it was definitely harrowing, palms sweaty heart racing, it felt good to be in that state so I can learn to control it better. Took enough profit for a McRib 😎",1635802989,hixohbx
"Same here, i looped my self into loopring when i heard the gme stuff, power to the players...",1635802942,hixod4y
He means the Q4 results or Earning Reports for public companies. It's believed that either Loopring or Gamestop or both will officially announce the partnership (or lack thereof) in their Q4 results. Probably Dec-Jan.,1635802931,hixoc6s
I sold my loopring. Sorry guys. I only had 100 dollars but sold for 155. I'm sure it will moon now but tbh just want some more money to throw at eth on the next dip,1635802319,hixmurv
Loopring holding nicely at 98 - can’t wait to see it boom to 2,1635802160,hixmh4i
Loopring to the moon!,1635802076,hixm9ov
Can you elaborate on this? Genuinely curious about the deficiencies of loopring vs. other L2s. Thanks!,1635800921,hixji0l
Loopring is apparently partner of choice. I'm buying the shit out of that rumour,1635800759,hixj3sh
The founder of loopring is the head of Blockchain at GameStop,1635800605,hixiqct
"Actually, just keep it in Loopring for a while. Once GameStop does the announcement, that shit will blow up. If you want to, you can convert it back to BTC after the pump.",1635800154,hixhn44
Where to buy loopring?,1635800097,hixhi5d
$50 dot keep it going! Good for you Loopring people but today has always been dots day!!,1635799566,hixg75q
"Pump aside, the more I read about loopring the cooler it sounds.  This could be a game changer for NFTs.",1635799562,hixg6tx
"This week is the NY NFT event. If WU TANG perform there then that’s got to be the nail in the coffin. NFT dividend, shorts have to close GME goes boom and Loopring goes to the moon with it. Exciting week ahead",1635799497,hixg121
Polygons market cap is like 10x higher but loopring is a major layer 2 competitor and uses zkrollups which are more secure,1635799441,hixfw3f
Holy shit you’re gonna make a lot of money! Keep the profits in Loopring and then transfer back to bitcoin the amount you put in. At least it was Loopring and not some horrible coin lol,1635799390,hixfrhi
"I highly doubt Coinbase would do that. You have literally made a trade on the actual market. (Not just a ‘conversion). So if you want your BTC back you ought to do the reverse trade. 

On the other hand Loopring is (in my opinion) about to go on a face melting run.  So you could ride it out and see an increase in value.  Depends on your risk tolerance",1635799302,hixfjuk
"Come on Loopring, that’s enough foreplay.",1635799281,hixfhyg
"Year end doesn't really mean anything, I see the rumour mill slowly grinding the price ever up until the actual official announcement and following media attention which will likely drive a massive retail investor spike. I'm assuming all this should happen by years end as I imagine GME will be eager to ride the recent attention and price action.

Considering market value at present and trends of other coins in the market I would say post media buying at a market cap between $10-20B although a wider range between $5-40 is still not impossible.

Long term I have no idea, that's down to far more factors than we could ever know.

Then again GME could turn around and say they are not using Loopring in which case it's rash time, that's why they call it high risk after all.",1635799088,hixf0jd
Guys I did a stupid. I accidently converted all my Bitcoin to LoopRing on Coinbase - I meant to convert some other random coin and I just kept clicking through until I looked later. Should I convert back myself or ask CoinBase to revert it? (I'm in the US so I want to do the least amount of movement for tax purposes),1635799084,hixf07v
Will Loopring allow me to buy/sell specific tokens directly to and from my bank account? I don't want to have to buy ETH just to swap it for another coin.,1635798976,hixeqha
I honestly think this might be the last time to buy Loopring for under $1.,1635798729,hixe4fa

You guys love to hate on nfts and how dumb they are except when it involves loopring. Curious🧐,1635798276,hixcz7t
"Well it seems like Uniswap and Loopring both support direct wallet connection, but they have the problem of not linking directly to a bank account for buy/selling purposes. Coinbase and Kraken can link to a bank account, but don't have wallet support. It seems like it's one or the other and I don't see why they can't do both. Seems like a no-brainer to me.",1635797975,hixc7ul
"Marketcap = supply x last traded price

Most of the time when estimating what can be a reasonable return for a coin, I compare the marketcap to the marketcap of a competitor/other coin.

Loopring and Polygon are both Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, so if we assume that loopring may reach the marketcap of Polygon, the return would be as follows:

P Mcap: 12.9B$
LRC Mcap: 1.247B$

12.9 / 1.247 = x10

So a return of x10 is POSSIBLE for LRC. Please note I speak of possibilities and not certainties",1635797863,hixbxjt
I wished I bought Loopring. These are meme level gains,1636485204,hjyyx9d
"It doesn't change the fact that to get in and out of loopring or any other l2 solution you have to do 2 on chain eth transactions.

"If you like the technology and believe in it then hold it.

If you feel like there are smoke and mirrors with a project sell it.

Better yet- find something that is aiming to do what Loopring does (but better) and is a baby.

Look between 10-100mil mcap and it doesn’t need to climb that high in the ranks to be a great investment.

Just make sure they are developing and NOT marketing. I can’t stress enough how important this is.",1636483005,hjytdru

It's pumped so fecking hard, tech or no tech that pump is astronomical and if it's all hype and no tech it'll crash and burn eventually",1636482418,hjyrw6k
"Yeah. I was gonna say the same thing. There was a post about tell me what coin you have without telling me which coin you have. Someone commented the most hyped coin and 2 people responded ""Loopring?""

"I posted this as a comment to someone, felt it might help others understand WHY there is a hype around LRC thus creating a new comment. 


Of course I'd suggest to do your own research but here's a bit of a summary. Feel free to help me add the sources:


Facts: 


1. Listed as a coin to watch on Greyscale (Canadian retirement fund with $40bn AUM) the previous coin to get accepted 2x'd in the same month. Source: Founder on twitter posting screenshot of document from Greyscale



2. Fee-less wallet will launch this week on the L2. So setting up a wallet which currently costs 150usd will become 0. Source: their Dev's on discord. Update: New changes on GitHub reflect this already! 



3. Staking will also be available via their official wallet 



4. Bank of China Patent includes use of LRC as you may be aware of it. 



5. Q4 2021 announcement nearing everyday 



6. GitHub code shows GameStop services mentioned twice. One time regarding export of NFT and later on in the second leak showed their beta testing url (staging server) whose SSL certificate ownership lies with GameStop.


7. 10% burn on transaction fees 



8. Exchanges if they want to use loopring need to hold 250k LRC on-chain or 1m LRC off-chain - which means every new exchange on this will reduce the supply of coins on the market.


9. The new wallet supports Fiat ramp-on and Fiat ramp-off 


10. Being Layer 2 and having ZK-Rollup allows it to process 4000 transactions per second. Once Eth 2.0 goes live, this will scale up as well. 


Opinion:



1. GME announcement about their NFT market place will be a huge 10x event for the coin 



2. Relatively low market cap and wide wallet acceptance will sky rocket the price


3. Personally, I feel we are looking at a $10 coin in the next 6-8 months. 

4. The coin has still not hit mainstream youtubers. I feel anything under 2.5usd would be a decent price to get in 


Note: I have tried being as bias free as possible but I want to let the community know that 100% of my portfolio is LRC. It's equivalent to my one month salary for perspective.",1636482214,hjyrdpc
"Loopring

NFT 3.0 and ""rumored"" partnership with a gaming company reinventing itself.",1636481991,hjyqti1
"Yes Loopring has a lot of long term potential, as long ofcourse if that potential is reached.   
Hype in the short-term does not say anything about the long-term potential, fundamentals or technology of the project in my view.  


My plan is to take profits into the hype; (e.g. the GME announcement (still a rumor), the wallet announcement). I will certainly keep LRC on my radar and hold a small bag, but I suspect a big dump after the initial big pump of the positive news. Long-term potential or not, this market just reacts insanely towards hype.  


Fundamentals and hype can go hand in hand, but are in my eyes at least for certain periods not strongly correlated. But I would like to be proven wrong on this specific case",1636481825,hjyqeof
"On the whole, yes but thanks to reddit (not this channel) I bought Loopring a couple of weeks ago and are being well rewarded for doing so.",1636481703,hjyq3s6

"I like Loopring as a project in general, my biggest beef with the whole project now that I have a bag is the smart wallet you refer to in your post that costs a fee to setup.

You present it in this post like an afterthought, but it turns out the fee for setting that wallet up is SUBSTANTIAL. When I checked yesterday it was about 5 hundred dollars. This appears to be a straight out of pocket costs with no asset return, just the ability to have a wallet that can interact with the DEX and other LRC projects. I can understand a small cost to recoup development fees or whatever, but this seems completely out of whack and kind of predatory. 

Since you obviously know the project well what is your take on this cost for the wallet?",1635877976,hj1k2q8

"Right. It's Lightning for ETH. Much needed. Cool project. Have been hesitant to put much time or capital into ETH until they solve the gas price problem. Ethereum has some expensive barriers to entry that are keeping demand low, I think. 32 ETH minimum to run a node? $300 gas fee on a $100 transaction? 

Even with a Layer 2 solution like Loopring, this is what I'm taking away from these two:

Bitcoin = Crypto-based freedom for all. Anyone can get deeply involved with minimal investment. Is a fractal, and individuals can benefit even at small scales.

Ethereum = Future corporate tech ecosystem. Only companies and wealthy individuals can play. High barrier to entry, benefits come with larger scaling.",1635877898,hj1jvg2

"You need to remember that this was written before the roadmap was changed, so this is talking about the roadmap as it was before. The original roadmap was this:
1. Launch the beacon chain, which is a new blockchain that runs in parallel with the current proof-of-work chain, that is designed to act as the central hub managing all shards.
2. Launch a number of shards, which are secondary blockchains that are designed to be managed by the beacon chain. Initially, only 64 shards were to be launched, with 1 shard acting as the ""main"" shard, capable of transaction and contract execution, and the other 63 shards acting as just data containers for the main shard to store data in.
3. Work on allowing the other 63 shard chains to support transaction and contract execution. This is a harder problem to solve, because it involves precise synchronisation of everything, which is a problem when factoring in latencies, so this was expected to take some time to figure out.
4. Once the other 63 shard chains supported transaction and contract execution, the current proof-of-work chain would be merged in with one of these shards, effectively becoming a shard in itself.
5. Other miscellaneous updates.

This would have addressed scalability by basically splitting the entire network up into 64 individual chains that are capable of executing their own transactions in parallel, on top of allowing the devs to launch even more shards if necessary (so we could theoretically have thousands of shards executing thousands of transactions in parallel).

However, since the original plan was devised, network usage grew to the point where waiting was no longer an option, but the original plan would only work if each shard was capable of executing its own transactions independently from the other shards, but, as I said, that's not an easy problem to solve.

At the same time, the community was working on their own solutions via side chains and primitive Layer 2 scaling (plasma and state channels), eventually settling on rollups as the solution for Layer 2 scaling.

Rollups work by basically performing transaction *execution* off chain en masse, and posting transaction *data* on chain in a highly compressed form, allowing the transactions to inherit the security of the underlying chain, combined with mechanisms to verify and contest/attest the validity of the transaction data posted on chain (fraud proofs for optimistic rollups, and validity proofs for ZK rollups, which Loopring is a ZK rollup).

Rollups are an effective means of scaling a network, as they make better use of limited block space, and handle execution off chain without sacrificing the security of the transactions themselves. Hence, in an effort to further improve rollups, the roadmap was changed to this:
1. Launch the beacon chain (we're here).
2. Merge the current proof-of-work chain into the beacon chain, causing the current proof-of-work chain to become shard #0 (the first shard of the Ethereum network, remembering that computers count from 0), or the main shard.
3. Launch a number of data-only shards, 63 in particular, that can be used by the main shard to store extra data within. Remembering that rollups *love* extra data, this basically means that rollups can scale beyond what they can right now, using the new data-only shards.
4. If a single executable shard isn't enough, work on allowing a number of the other 63 shards to be able to execute transactions and contracts themselves.
5. Other miscellaneous updates.

Scalability is addressed right now via rollups, but data-only sharding allows rollups to perform even better, improving scalability further, and so the roadmap was changed to bring data-only sharding to the live network as soon as possible.",1635857852,hj081t5

"LRC is likely pumping because of GME hype.... something about an NFT marketplace, or so it would seem.

I am bullish on LRC (for a long time now) because they are working on zero knowledge proof rollups. 

From an L2 scaling perspective there's 3 ways to go... sidechains (polygon), optimistic rollups (arbitrum, cartesi), zero knowledge proofs rollups (loopring).

Sidechains are basically just another blockchain that bridges easily to main chain.  These can be fast and cheap by sacrificing decentralization in favor of efficiency.  They are easy to build.

Both flavors of rollups are ""better"" than sidechains because their transactions are recorded to main chain periodically, they retain the decentralization properties of the main chain but also have low fees and fast execution.  This is a bit out of my technical depth... but from what I understand, optimistic rollups are a little easier to build but not quite as useful as zk rollups.  VB has written about it alot (over my head) but he expects it will be sidechains for a while, then optimistic rollups for a while, then zk rollups eventually winning.",1635857585,hj07jfp

"Polygon Matic is a side chain, it's fundamentally an entirely separate network with its own consensus and security, that supports the EVM (which is the beating heart of Ethereum), can have assets moved to and from it via a bridge to the Ethereum network, but is ultimately less secure than the Ethereum network.

Loopring is a Layer 2 rollup, which is a bit harder to explain. Rollups are basically systems that are built on top Ethereum, that are capable of performing transaction *execution* off chain, but posting transaction *data* on chain in a highly compressed form. By performing transaction execution off chain, you gain the same speed benefit as having a side chain, but by posting transaction data on chain, you basically have your transactions inherit the security from the underlying chain.

There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the gist. Polygon is fundamentally separate to Ethereum and is less secure, Loopring is an ecosystem built on top of Ethereum and is more secure. Loopring isn't the only L2 rollup, there's 18 of them available right now, including ones that are more general purpose, like Polygon (Loopring can be thought of as just a dex with some transfer capabilities).

In short, if gamestop marketplace and nft marketplace take off, because they are big, and first movers in that scale, then loopring could be set as the core of nfts for the gaming industry. Not because it is the best option, nor the most fancy token, but because the motto “build it and they will come” stands the test of time.

Consider how many games have the same rules, sort of the same look, and then consider that you could take your favorite counterstrike knife and use it in battlefield 3000 or trade it in league of legends for a green wolfskin hat for your hero. And that is just ingame.
Next consider a standard game ownership contract, meaning that you can at some point in the future give or trade your used games, in the gamestop market, across any platform, and restrictions like steam and bungie and EA have now will be shunned like ancient tech.

"This one in particular isn't, but others are. Loopring is a type of Layer 2 (L2) network called a rollup, which basically takes bundles of transactions, processes them off chain, then posts transaction data back onto the Layer 1 (L1) chain, so that the transactions themselves are secured by the L1.

Loopring is specifically a type of rollup called a ZK rollup, which is a more secure and cheaper rollup that has one major downside: it currently doesn't support the EVM, which is the beating heart of the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Hence, Loopring's exchange features are built directly into the rollup, as opposed to existing within the rollup -- a big distinction.

There's also another type of rollup called an optimistic rollup, which is less secure and more expensive than ZK rollups, but has full support for the EVM, and so can theoretically support any Ethereum application (Uniswap, AAVE, 1INCH, Chainlink, Celer CBridge, DAI, etc). The most commonly used optimistic rollup is Arbitrum, and Arbitrum already has a number of applications launched on it, including a few exchanges, making it a competitor to Loopring.

Polygon is an example of a side chain, which is a network that is running on its own blockchain, with its own consensus mechanism and security, with full support for the EVM, complete with numerous Ethereum applications, as well as a bridge that connects the Polygon network to Ethereum. The downside of a side chain is that assets that exist within the Polygon network aren't secured by Ethereum, but by the Polygon blockchain, which means they're less secure (the entire reason why gas fees are as high as they are is because Ethereum is prioritising security over scalability).

Because Polygon has full support for the EVM, it can't really be compared with Loopring. It'd be better to compare Loopring to a Polygon-powered Uniswap, as both are decentralised exchanges running on cheap-to-use networks. The actual comparison would be to Arbitrum or, better yet, the upcoming StarkNet ZK rollup, which will have full support for the EVM.",1635853950,hj016r2

"copy / paste from the web

What is Loopring? (LRC)  
The Beginner’s Guide  
Loopring is a software running on Ethereum that aims to incentivize a global network of users to operate a platform that enables the creation of new types of crypto asset exchanges.   
One of an emerging number of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, Loopring uses multiple cryptocurrencies, including its own LRC cryptocurrency, to together provide for this platform.  
Most notably, Loopring claims its platform will allow exchanges built on top of it to sidestep the slow speeds and high costs associated with decentralized exchanges on Ethereum through the use of a newer type of cryptography called zero-knowledge rollups, or zkRollups.   
With zkRollups, Loopring asserts its exchanges can offer faster settlements for traders. Rather than settling trades on the Ethereum blockchain directly (as other decentralized exchanges do), zkRollups enable Loopring exchanges to complete key computations elsewhere.   
The idea is that this can reduce the number of transactions that a Loopring exchange will need to submit to the Ethereum network, thus increasing speed and reducing costs for traders.   
This is in contrast to other decentralized exchanges, where trades require transactions to be confirmed by the Ethereum network, taking minutes instead of seconds or milliseconds.",1635852996,hizzpg1
