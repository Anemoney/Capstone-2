"People love some vindication in the face of uncertainty that they’ve committed to. 

My issue was the wife made me promise not to buy more GME once I reached my goal, as a student. But I rolled some money into exploring crypto when NFT.GameStop.com showed up, to at least get a head start. Got into a play-to-earn NFT game, that went half rug-pull because it got too popular, too fast. It’s still struggling, but exists. I made some good trades, and got frustrated with gas fees. Learned so much, staked some, provided liquidity, suffered impermanent loss, but was glad I sold. My first non-marginal gains were LRC. Their DEX is amazing, and I’ve made actual gains there. I’m no longer wholly dependent on the rumoured partnership for my investment. 

I won’t be setting any reminders. You’re civil, come from a place of logic, and are obviously in the process of learning. I won’t revel in you eating crow, any more than I would.

My main theory for LRC is that it's just a new SLGG.

Big pump, spreading if rumours, apes divesting from GME to get on the rumoured partner, then slow killing of the value of the rumoured partner's stock/coin.

Doesn't even need to be with the complicity of SLGG or Loopring. Send ""apes"" to both forums to foment, isolate SuperStonk and GME investors from other possible investors, and reap money from a slow motion pump and dump.

Art of war, use the enemies resources against them. The money for the pump goes to pay the shills.

If you're an investor, LRC is more of a ""buy and hold;"" if they're technology is heavily used/adopted, that means every company that onboards has to own LRC and part of it is burned off over time with a finite supply (deflationary).

Seeing LRC/WETH means the value of Loopring against Ethereum (you may also see such things as ETHUSD -- Ethereum price vs dollar which is the $3000 or $4000 that u see in the news).

Showing off a trading pair like this in the Metaverse is another cohencidence.",1640965974,hqoybhu

WETH is used to buy and sell with auctions on OpenSea. ETH and WETH are worth exactly the same amount and can be exchanged directly on your OpenSea profile.

&amp;#x200B;

Putting that all together it seems like this NFT may be a way to convert LRC to WETH which could be collateral for an upcoming purchase.

Him not actively stating he's an advisor is a null point.  Just like if he were still active,  it doesn't prove much either. 

It really comes down to a lot of coincidences. No there's nothing definitive that confirms a thing.

Right now gamestop has Matt finestone who left loopring at a peak project and kept an advisory role/ investment position.  And rk, who apparently openly holds some form of lrc . These aren't direct or definitive links,  but they are 2 links, one stronger than the other.

It looks like Matt Finestone (head of division) [https://twitter.com/finestonematt](https://twitter.com/finestonematt)  has a background with Loopring (LRC coin) - I am wondering whether zkRollup protocol will be used on Gamestop's new platform.,1621999647,gzh0sv0
"Almost bought LRC, but then I thought ""why would someone put money into Loopring when they have GME?"".",1637791699,hlygias
"Loopring is a non profit company, it isn’t public ally traded. The lrc coin is its internal governance coin. You can stake with so many coins and earn money from fees and such or state to have certain functions of the features as loop ring rolls them out. I’m not a crypto ape so don’t know the intricacies but buying over 50% of the coins available wouldn’t do much. Some crypto companies allocate things to be voted on and more coins you have the more your vote counts. I don’t know if this is true for loopring but they cannot hold a majority of the coins and take over the business. Does that answer your question?",1637791615,hlygamw

"It genuinely hurts me how people on here refuse to think for themselves. Just genuinely turn off all analytical thinking and go with whatever one dude they don't know said, like on facebook. Dr. Metzler specifically reports his findings on Tether and tether alone and I well believe them. Why the crypto hate? Unless it's LRC, apparently we love that crypto cause they may provide the NFT platform to GME. But we conveniently forget that LRC runs on top of etherium, and that NFTs are a feature of etherium. I just... AAHHH!",1637790671,hlydw4j
This is a question I’d also like to know the answer too. Lol. As a LRC holder I would love it tho,1637790546,hlydktd
"Huh, he specifically says they do NOT plan to release an NFT marketplace and this is from just a few months ago. I suppose GameStop could still be planning to release one using Loopring. But honestly, I don't think another OpenSea is much of a game changer, even one with fees that are 400 times lower.

So if LRC isn't working on an NFT marketplace, I'm going to assume (based on little to nothing) that means they also aren't helping or aware of anyone else doing so with their technology. If that assumption is correct, then all of the GameStop execs showing an interest in NFTs lends more credence to the idea of an NFT dividend or just straight up replacing their shares with NFTs.

That tweet from a while back by Matt Finestone about redesigning the global financial system being hard would line up perfectly with that assumption. And the same tweet wouldn't make any sense if they were just designing a way to buy/sell used digital games or hello kitty jpegs.

"after that, a congressional meeting is called. lots of jacking off, nothing's done.

the next few months see interesting and sometimes violent swings with gamestop stock (yet it always continues to rise). diamond hands are born. the movement builds on reddit. mainstream media tell people to go home, forget gamestop, shorts have covered, it's over (perhaps too insistently). zen mode discovered. dfv posts a final yolo video where he doubles down on his bet by buying 50k shares at market price ($150 per share at the time, for a $7.5M buy-in). diamond balls are forged. reddit gets reddit-y and starts internet sleuthing. lots of DD is born. lots of likely secret ingredient (crime) is uncovered. diamond hearts are strengthened. ape = all people equal. as people learn about it, the movement picks up steam around the world. a banana is put in a hole.

during this time, ryan cohen tweets like a prophetic madman eating 3 doritos locos tacos while pulling fat rips off his 'small wee wee' bong. numbers are explored.. 69, 420, 741. pee pee and poo poo is scrutinized for meaning. he walks among us occasionally retweeting the best of ape offerings. over the months, he and gme recruit talent from the likes of chewy, amazon, facebook, google, wayfair, zulily, and now apple. gme sells shares to clear off practically all debt and build up a nearly $2B warchest. rc follows his chewy playbook by securing warehouses and tackling supply/fulfillment/shipping. gme expands their online store offerings, introducing new products and product categories.

apes discover that they don't actually own their shares. massive DRS migration over to computershare begins. first of its kind in history. DRSing removes shares from the institutions making them no longer available for shorting, and places them in your name as they should have been in the first place when you bought them. what will happen when all the shares that are supposed to exist for a company are DRS'd and shf's can no longer short a stock? pee pee happy and price go up?

apes discover loopring. the company is poised to release a highly anticipated technology/software that would allow creation of an nft marketplace, as well as reducing outrageous gas fees and welcoming tens of millions of users to a whole new metaverse (fuck fb). some apes start buying up LRC in anticipation of a possible (probable?) partnership announcement between gme and loopring. could this help launch everything to the stratosphere and beyond?

and now here we are. so is it all an idiotic conspiracy or a sick and twisted snl sketch? you'll have to decide for yourself. read the due diligence. watch some videos with ryan cohen. listen to the man talk. see if you think he has the business acumen to help transform gamestop and lead it to a new era. even if you think the moass and selling one share for millions is utterly ridiculous, just look at the fundamentals (which are very strong). moass and millions is just the possible cherry on top that help keep tittays jacked round here. would the world be better off if greedy billionaires weren't greedy billionaires and wealth wasn't ripped and robbed from the masses? lfgggggg!!!!!",1637747382,hlvtku3

"My theory is that LRC and options are distractions to prevent people from DRSing more. One could argue that LRC and options are the new popcorn. While these investments don't directly harm gme, SHFs can manage these risks more than they can manage DRSed GME shares. 

If someone thinks that they can make a quick 2x-3x return on LRC, then they will divert some of their gme monies there. Hedgies will keep gme flat for a long time while maybe loading up on LRC. Eventually some people get bored of GME and think of moving some of their investment to LRC.


If someone thinks that they can make some quick money on OTM calls, then hedgies burn them by never letting the price cross the strike.


If someone thinks that they can make some quick money on ITM calls, then hedgies let the stock ride for a few days to give 5x paper gains and let greed take over. (Everyone wants to be the next gamecock.) When there are only a few days remaining, they crash the stock. The rapid theta decay delivers the final blow. My theory here is that as soon as Shitadel detected that a few traders are cashing in their paper gains, they crashed the price. Otherwise they would have let the stock run to attract more traders. In other words, Shitadel is pulling the levers so that options traders are pitched against each other. The first ones to cash out their gains win. The ones who wait are the bagholders. 


Shitadel does not have the ability to make arbitrary movements in the stock, but they control enough levers to fuck with a small portion of investors. Their goal would be to get some traders addicted to options. Shitadel wins whenever a trader gets obsessed with making up for their losses through increasingly riskier bets.

Shitadel knows how many shares are remaining at DTC. They know how many shares are counterfeit. They have a singular goal: convince enough non-DRSed retail investors to paperhand at sub 10k price. It's safe to say that any investor who has DRSed at least one share is going to diamond hand most of their shares to insane levels. Shitadel is unsure how diamond handed non-DRSed apes are. They are trying to cause attrition in this group to get a better picture of how high MOASS is gonna go. Remember that if every week a million shares are DRSed and holders of 2 million non-DRSed shares are convinced to paperhand, then hedgies see that as a win. 

If you know someone who hasn't DRSed, then educate them about the process so that they can decide for themselves how they wanna proceed.",1637736423,hlvfg8z

Besides, what's to distract from? The front page isn't full of loopring posts.  Quality DD still gets plenty of upvotes.  Everyone knows the way is Buy, DRS and Hold.

It is in Loopring's best interest to create speculation around a partnership with Gamestop to sell their tokens. Their tokens, as far as I'm concerned, has no value to anyone outside of speculation, and ""staking."" If people wanted to do that, they can just buy ETH or any ERC20 token and stake it in a contract somewhere. The more push for LRC I see, the more I think it's ridiculous.",1637721116,hlun4u7

"So I have some experience in this area. This app is a web app and IS NOT a crypto wallet (sorry other user). This is a fully fledged trading platform with a very large selection of crypto trading pairs. All the crypto pairs seem to be Etheriium based pairs (lookup ERC--20 tokens). Layer 2 means reduced gas fees to make it actually tradeable, otherwise we'd see transactions costing $50 per buy or sell roughly depending on network congestion.

Finally, the wallets. It doesn't provide one. You are required to bring your own. There are two options, Met4Mask and WaletConnect which are super popular options. The first is basically what every trader uses and the second allows certain other platforms which may not support chrome browser extensions, like certain hardware based crypt wallets.

All in all, it's a trading platform. I see the order book and pairs and wallet integration. Very standard but seems very powerful 

Edit: the default trading pair is LRC-ETH. LRC is loopring coin? Haven't heard of this before so must be new",1634046735,hgcrbwz

Gas is insane these days. Converting ETH to LRC is even more expensive because they are not the same standard. Metamask might also be including slippage fees. Coinbase can convert eth to lrc much more cheaply than doing it via a DEX,1633728759,hfwkuzi
"Right now, the token is mostly used to provide liquidity to the protocol. LRC holders can put their tokens in a liquidity pool and earn extra rewards for doing so. 

However, in the future LRC holders will be in charge of the Loopring dao that will get a portion (last I checked 10%) of fees put in the dao treasury and letting the dao decide what to do with the money, whether that’s a token buyback, issuing dividends, or incentivizing more usage on the platform.  In the future, LRC holders will also be able to put their LRC in an insurance fund for any catastrophic bug and also earn rewards that way.

If I am being honest, I am not really a huge fan of LRC tokenomics. If you want to earn on your LRC the best way is really though providing liquidity but that comes with its own issues. The token is really there to incentivize usage of the platform and making it better to use but it’s not really connected to a lot of ways to earn a lot of money if that’s what you are looking for. That being said, I don’t believe the tokenomics are set in stone and they can increase the fees holders earn if they can reduce the fees users have to pay right now, which I believe is likely. 

I do think though that the more the protocol grows the more LRC will be worth. But it’s not really a coin I think is worth shilling because of the reasons I mentioned above.",1633726209,hfwevy4
"That's exactly why it's assumed Loopring is part of the plan. LRC is a Layer 2 chain, essentially a faster processing unit for a specific subset of coins/tokens on the chain. Using Loopring, gas fees would be miniscule.",1633726080,hfwekia
"You probably could use LRC but owning LRC is not really a requirement to use Loopring. I see purchasing with either Ether or tokenized dollars like USDC or Dai much more likely.

When this launches, I should be able to buy and trade NFTs with any currency (including a credit card according to their discord) instantly and without any kind of fee. This opens up NFTs to a vastly greater audience allowing then to truly go mainstream. 

The sheer number of people this will attract is going to be huge. NFTs are the blue ocean market that will completely revolutionize GameStop.

"Hmmm... I always thought Loopring was where we were moving to.  Loopring states that in Q4 their platform will be ready - which sits in line with where we are... A week away from Q4  (Article below... Finely written by none other than... Matt finestone).

I think the answer was in the GameStop prospectus all along... We were never going to trigger MOASS ourselves.  I mean, how can we really when we are playing their game, by their rules that change and get delayed at the drop of a hat.  The people that believed in a need for systemic change knew this ... The likes of Ryan, DFV, Gensler, and Michael burry all knew from their experiences what they were up against.  I would like to believe that they perhaps ""met in person"" (I know... my bad attempt at a dig to Shitadel) and came up with a grand plan... A plan to run a real life simulation that proved without a shadow of doubt the kind of crime that was going on... that no matter the different methods that normally would have been a catalyst for a huge rally in just about any other stock, it wasn't.. or more like... ""couldn't"" be the case as they were too deep in already.

And that's the key.  For the last 9 months they showed all the manipulations and GME was the key because for any consistently positive event they had to still show a negative or near neutral outcome as it would otherwise risk their sustainability.

Loopring or LRC.

&gt;Also can you elaborate on the cost of creating wallets? 

In order to transact coins on Loopring's layer 2, the coins must first be committed to an appropriate wallet. This wallet exists on the Ethereum blockchain as a type of smart contract. Establishing that wallet contract requires interacting with other smart contracts on the blockchain and that interaction has an associated cost. Currently that cost is around $200+ and will fluctuate with the price of Eth. Removing coins from the wallet so they can be used anywhere else would require additional fees.",1632785617,hej441f

"That’s funny you bring up ETH because I almost included it in my previous comment. I don’t see anyone posting about it, or I would’ve said something. If they do speak of it, it’s paired with LRC usually in discussion about gas fees/nft marketplace.  

Yeah, herein lies the problem I guess..it’s hard talk about the suspected Loopring partnership without mentioning the token. Just seems like OUR sub has been abused to promote the token, the way they seem so straightforward on the “apes adoption” of LRC in their sub seemed somewhat exploitative. Look at posts from about a month back. I feel the same way about people who try to get others to just FOMO blindly into GME.   

The reason I bring any of this up is the sub has never had another ticker allowed this much, for so long. It has been acknowledged somewhat in the past, chared at one point had a section about it in their daily pinned comments. I thought it would be easy to just say “loopring token” in its place as this would discourage lazy shilling BUT I guess that creates problems in itself and may cease proper discussion like in your example. 

I did not intend to proof or ban type of request of you or anyone else but man that would be a cool flair to have... kidding, really, truly not my intentions but it was easy to suspect just with how you all handled LRC in comparison to the other “meme” stocks and crypto but this could also be because you guys haven’t  received a lot of pushback due to the GME relation.   

(Lot of thinking straight into this comment here so I apologize again, perspective changing as I type)

I’ll be forthright and say I’m excited for what’s to come and I do hope everything speculated that’s related to GameStop is true. I don’t have much else to add.

"&gt;but still don’t understand why LRC is allowed to be talked about here.

Do you have the same questions as to why Ethereum is able to be discussed here (curious as not even back in July Ethereum was a banned word here as well). Only those working on the projects would know the direct relationship of LRC and GME at this time (if any at all). 

However, the continuous trickle of leaks in code, connections on social media, etc. heavily insinuates some sort of relationship between LRC and GME exists. Yes, with nothing confirmed this could be all be a nothingburger, but boy it would be a big one at this point (IMHO).

&gt;Also, my questions have not been acknowledged as far as mods owning LRC, seeing how discussions can be made using loopring in lieu of their security it just doesn’t make sense.

Is it a requirement mods share their ownership in anything/everything? I will not speak for others, but since I utilize ENS and have made dismal-jellyfish.eth a known wallet for some of my holdings, the information is completely public and [you can look it up if you are curious](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbbbbca6a901c926f240b89eacb641d8aec7aeafd?a=0x6b597f7e48b573ab9029d9ae9fae7d78cfd8d435)? I hope a transfer from almost 6 months ago for holding purposes passes suspicion for being compromised as to pushing any sort of narrative? 

However, none of this comes to mind when moderating the sub and anything I come across--this is a GameStop subreddit, so the discussion needs to be relevant to GameStop and many (not all, that is for sure) of the posts I have seen fall into this category--wondering about who the premium partner is, do they need the loopring wallet they can get now or wait for the counterfactual one (someone could end up wasting a bunch of LRC if they make the incorrect call on this for example?), if GME is leveraging LRC in the marketplace and NFTs truly become feeless to transfer, won't this crank up transaction volume (and generate all sorts of fees for GME--OpenSea will eat its heart out?) would be huge for the bottom line, right?

Does discussion like the above promote lrc? Sure, but again in this context of aligned interests (like Ethereum), and I personally view it as relevant to what GME is proposing to do in the NFT space? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I know this is coming off bluntly and I’m sorry for that but it’s quite annoying when half of the posts are about crypto or vague twitter screenshots of that scene. They have their own sub.

I don't know a lot about LRC but I don't think it was subject to the same financial terrorism, and therefore of course will have ATHs this year, their biggest and most productive year yet.

"Wait, you really think LRC is a pure speculatory investment? 

I think Loopring is entering the space of building a trading exchange. People and businesses who use their services will pay them fees. Participants who stake their coins to facilitate trades will get a cut from them.

Intercontinental exchange, which owns a lot of exchanges and clearing houses around the world, generates a net income of 2 billion per year. That puts its marketcap at 75 billion. LRC currently has a market cap of 3.5 billion.

I don't want to make any guesses on where LRC is headed, but it would be nice if people looked at some raw numbers before speculating where their investment is headed. 


An investment in GME is backed by two solid arguments:

1) a turnaround plan that's gonna position the company at the center of Tech and Gaming industry. 

2) mega financial institutions who are legally obligated to be future buyers of the stock. 

For those of you who think that without (2) the first argument can only bring small returns, let me tell you where you are mistaken. GME's share price used to be quite high around 2008 and around 2013-2014. Just assuming moderate inflation, moderate growth, and the fact that we are in the end stages of the biggest bull run ever, GME should have been valuated at its current prices (assuming RC hadn't entered the scene and hedgies were not actively trying to sabotage the company). While RC (and DFV) helped breaks the shackles that GME was bound to, the market has yet to reprice GME based on RC's transformation. 

It's really important that people let go of the notion that 30x of RC's eventual contribution to GME has been priced in. This couldn't be further from the truth. Retail investors claiming ownership of the company helped the stock return to its current fair value. RC has yet to unveil his plans that will generate 100x returns (that are backed with actual revenue and income numbers instead of speculation) in the long run. The fundamental value of GME is gonna increase 2x-3x every single year for the next few years.

I believe it's more likely LRC can go from $3 to $30 for x10 profit, then it is for GME to go from $222 to $2222 (I'd love for both to happen, x1000 even).

How many people believed BTC would never go anywhere and passed up buying it at $2-3, believing that price was ridiculous for a coin that only exists as data and which is generated out of thin air?

GME has a lot of smart tech people at the top now, if they partner with LRC on the NFT store, wouldn't it make sense for them to accept LRC as a payment option?

It has been shown that anyone could have posted this. Why? Because they stand to make a ton of money pumping lrc, If there is money to be made, someone, somewhere will put the effort in. Case closed.

Anyone could have inserted it.** But you still say only partially unjack the tits? **This looks very disingenuous.**   
At this point, with all the misinformation, **far from having tits in any state of jack over this, apes should actively be on their guard. This looks like a pump and dump.**

If these leaks wouldn't have an ounce of truth in them, I think that loopring themselves would have stepped in by now to deny any speculations as the result from all of this being untrue would hurt the company's credibility in the long run.

Yes LRC is a side chain of Eth, but most of the gains will be for LRC, not Eth.

GameStop are going to LRC. Not Eth directly.

1. Loopring showing a chart titled LRC but is definetly not LRC in the timeframe shown.
2. The chart looks kinda like GME
3. The head of blockchain at gamestop used to work for loopring
4. That same head of blockchain said that he thinks he will be seeing his colleges soon since he will be working in the same arena (in his departure letter)

Loopring is a L2 which means its goal is to save on gas fees. I can’t imagine if GME NFTs would issue on the main E-blockchain because gas fees would kill their entire reserve. Just imagine doing ~75m transactions for each share/nft. Gas fees would cost them hundreds of millions. That’s why they hired Matt from LRC- which is a zero-knowledge Rollup. This would allow them to issue NFTs in batches and pay fraction of the costs.,1630324950,hax3lzn
"Sorry if this has already been said in response but Loopring jumped 66% in a single day last week, fell back a little and jumped again around 44% I think yesterday. So there is a lot of potential with this relationship between GME and LRC.",1630313910,hawp24l

"[https://limechain.tech/blog/optimistic-rollups-vs-zk-rollups/](https://limechain.tech/blog/optimistic-rollups-vs-zk-rollups/)

 Loopring, focuses solely on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and payment applications. With Loopring anyone can become an operator of their own orderbook DEX or automated market maker (AMM) and take advantage of its ZK rollup technology to achieve high throughput at low gas cost – Loopring claims that its ZK rollup can reach up to 2,025 per second, while the cost per transaction is 100 lower than the same metric on Ethereum. Exchange operators are required to post a large bond (stake) in the protocol’s native LRC token.  
  
The Loopring moniker stems from one of the protocol’s most interesting features – order rings. An order ring is a circular trading system that contains up to 16 individual orders. So whereas a buy order typically has to be matched by an opposing sell order, and vice versa, orders in an order ring do not need direct matches to be executed. This system can result in better liquidity, price discovery and other benefits.",1629915009,hablc1w

or we are said that it is real. As long as nothing is confirmed LRC is sliding.,1636056763,hjbrdnk
I'm 999999% if neither GME or LRC make an announcement the forum sliding will be about LRC price and how the whole partnership is fake.,1636056638,hjbr29f
"Well, there is not much profit in stablecoins i believe. I think the whole point is they don't go to the moon. I am not a crypto expert myself, i already bought some regular LRC before i read this post and i'll hold that while i see how this plays out. Who knows, maybe it'll go the moon along with GME and if not i won't cry about it.",1636056283,hjbq5m9
"I bumbled my way through a coinbase account sign up yesterday. They got to the give me your banking login info part and I stopped. I just can't get myself to give up that kind of info. 

I assigned a card to it, but you can only transfer $300 a week with that, so that sucks. 

I know as much about crypto as I do about chain saw juggling. 🤷‍♀️

So far I have bought nothing, but I may grab some LRC while it is still cheap.",1636054869,hjbmj90
Yes only a few of us who actually research the claims.  Everyone else blindly follows everyone else.  I personally sold the LRC i had while it is still over a dollar.  It seems hype and fads dont last long in this space anymore so make the $$ while you can!,1636054639,hjblyob

"&gt;The fees you are talking about are literally only one time when you go from Level 1 to Level 2. 

Assuming you only make 1 deposit...

&gt;If you deposit multiple times from Level 1 then sure there is a fee. 

That's all I'm saying. This is an important point that many, including me, didn't know yesterday. 

&gt;Like I said, the idea is to stay on L2 once you get there. 

The minimum trade value doesn't make me want to stay. And how can I buy more LRC on layer 2 without another deposit???

&gt;And regarding your not being able to make 2 deposits, you’re clearly just doing something wrong? I’m not really sure on that though I haven’t set up my Smart Wallet yet.

I literally don't have enough money because it's $60 a deposit",1636052915,hjbhla1
"He loses all credibility when he says only GME could create that account when in fact, the account ID is auto generated when the first transaction is sent to that address. Furthermore, he says we can see test transactions taking place on the page as well. This is false, becaue one of those transactions is mine and I'm not affiliated with LRC. 

Just another ""influencer"" trying to make it.",1636052635,hjbgvl7
"from the way I understand it if a vendor let's you choose LETH and or LUSDC it's because loopring has a large pool for transfers across the two coins/tokens

kinda like at a dinner club when you goto pay the sign says we accept:
Mastercard
visa
discover
Amex

that dinner club believes the above creditors have the money to settle your bill and your card with the means the creditor believea you'll pay later in the month or pay with interest later 

LETH means your LRC is as good as eth

LUSDC means your LRC is as good as USDC which is as good as USD

I think this is what OP is getting at, this is why LRC at current is a great value, LRC is 96% out, buy it while it's cheap, supply shock will happen.

well done OP 👏",1636052259,hjbfxgi
"it's all speculation at the moment - RC/GameStop hasn't officially declared it, but it doesn't hurt to theorise as long as it's based on feasible concepts. there's a been a fair bit out about the relationships between LRC and GME but caution is advised!",1636051809,hjbesd3
Do you have any proof or announcement from loopring that these are legit/actually associated with LRC and or loopring?,1636051321,hjbdjdi
"That is an absolute possibility. I am slightly sus of them even posting this to a public repo HOWEVER I think it may be public because they are keeping their stuff open source, meaning the community has access to their code.

Three scenarios I'm my mind:
1.) It's a joke / troll from the Loopring team
2.) They are including GME to boost speculation and pump the price of LRC
3.) They have an unannounced partnership with GameStop and the source code they are working on is sort of a legal gray area.

All of the evidence that we have points to the partnership being real. So... 90% tiddy jack and 10% reserved for being misled.",1636050982,hjbcnut

My dollars?  All in on GME.

Never did crypto before period total noob. I am thinking I would like to buy some LRC as a speculative investment. Reading about this all morning. To me it seems like you can either buy from an exchange where it's held in an exchange, buy from an exchange and send to a L1 wallet with fees, or get the L2 wallet from Loopring and just use their DEX to get the currency. 

Trying to figure out what would be the best way to go. I'm not against paying for the L2 wallet if there are any real advantages? I think I read it was over 250 dollars to get one created and the added hassle of having to pay that fee in ETH? But like I said, if there are real advantages, even realized in the future, to just starting off with the Loopring wallet I'm not 100% against it.",1636041207,hjangen
"LRC promoters: Hey guys, look at this loopy ring post. It's going wild, you should get some I got mine!

"I had an intense dream about MOASS last night and I never remember my dreams. And this lasted all night. It was a MOASS movie.

Every share holder got on a bus to go to the registration machine. When you registered, you got 1LRC per share.

As thousands upon thousands of people registered, the price of LRC just kept going up and up.

No one wanted to sell their GME shares. Their currency was now LRC used for everything. And we were billionaires. The numbers were insane.

The only thing I remember shopping for before waking up was a house for my mom.

This was so real. It was so great. And it felt right. We are almost there.",1636031026,hj9zb1b
I followed the official tutorial on the LRC sub. Connected my Metamask wallet to their exchange and made a deposit to activate my layer 2 account. The fee was $57 to move $50 in ETH to layer 2.,1636029478,hj9wb54
"Thank you for the link. Everything I am about to say is directed at the authors of that site. not at you. I get that you are just trying to help by supplying the information that you believe to be bona fide. :) Feel free not to read the word wall below, and thank you again for the link.

However, I searched that site. There is no persuasive evidence at all of an imminent ""announcement of a GME-LRC NFT marketplace."" And a lot of the writing on the topic appears to me to be seeking to manipulate through speculation and innuendo, rather than to inform.

There are two articles implying an LR-GS connection. Both are speculative. One bases its speculation principally on the fact that MFin who used to be at LR is now at GS. (GS CEO Matt Furlong is from Am4z0n, but no one is speculating that GS is building something in the Zon ecosystem). There is some baffle-gab inserted about new t0ken capability in the 3TH space that is not particular to LR (any dev can make use of the t0ken type), so is irrelevant, but it sounds persuasive, right?

The other article is much more dangerous because it draws inferences about things that most apes don't understand like transactions and addresses. There is **no link to a source for the assertion that MFin owns the wallet in question** (I am not making a counter assertion, I am just saying that they are not citing sources for key factual assertions which is a very bad sign). 

And **if** MFin did a transaction from ***his*** wallet (it is alleged to be his, not a wallet belonging to GS), it has nothing to do with GS, no matter what he called the transaction or where it went. I can think of other reasons why he might make such a transaction.

I will do some checking of my own into this. And if this is bogus, I will be asking for a permaban on anyone referring people out to that site moving forward.

The article also says the LR CEO disclosed ""that the Ethereum-based technology company is working with a premium partner who demands they keep quiet."" And it then goes on to suggest the logical leap to GS, because *who else demands tight lips about the future business plans? RC, of course*. 

I mean, as if RC is the only tight lipped CEO and there are not 1000's of tech companies who have NDAs as a standard papering of any deal. I only mention this to show the caliber of ""evidence"" being used in this article. The article is absolutely grasping to pull straws out of its ass. It actually gets pure tabloid at one point, but let's move on.

What is really dangerous is the article making a point of **stating that MFin still holds a significant El Ar Cee position.** Do you know what that means? If there is a nefarious pump of that c0in, (like the one that has currently flared up in our sub) and the breadcrumbs lead back to him, he gets smeared with the same scammer label. So does GME by association and so does any subsequent NFT drop.

In short, the information is speculative, badly sourced, and draws inferences that are not logically sound. **The site displaying these articles has set itself up as a repository of GME DD, but we already have a collection of DD in our sub and in others. Could it be that it is trying to bypass controls on misinformation/lies/shilling in the reddit GME subs, because their whole purpose is to misinform/lie/shill?**",1636029447,hj9w8z0
"You need ask this over on a LRC sub, but it’s not that difficult or expensive. Not sure how you tried tho.",1636029408,hj9w69d
"Does anyone else thinks it’s odd that the frequency of this leaks have increased from LRC? I would love for gme to confirm / deny the leaks but until then apes need to member that there are bad actors out there that are taking advantage of us and the numbers behind us (case and point NFTcon). What does LRC have to gain? Well LRC is up 200% in the past month, seems like an easy way to make some coin..",1636028939,hj9vavn

"You definitely are. I bought 100 LRC on c01nbase, and it was fairly easy and it's still up 20%ish",1636028666,hj9uswv
"Go back and read some light DD I was giving in LRC thread comments.  Not only this nft marketplace but also the ability of sharding,  or fractionalized sales of rate nfts is HUGE.  That means a company like GME could create 1 NFT worth 76$million and make each shard or fraction of the whole worth a dollar,  thereby representing a peice of the whole value,  literally a L2 to traditional markets.  By doing that it established the future of private companies and where they think their money is best kept and valued. Then the ability to transfer or sell the shard,  with little to no transfer cost in a bid like setting, ""NFT Marketplace "" with open source price discovery and no ability to manipulate against counter positions. BULLISH,  TO ANDROMEDA BOISSSSSS",1636027558,hj9sva9
"&gt; I had a minimal amount left over in shitcoins that wasn't worth transferring out after all the fees to put in GME, so I moved it to LRC last week before it ran up. Side bet is the best way to play that, esp if it's just swapping coins. 

Ditto.  I do some light mining on my GPU and decided to dump some of that output into LRC as a side bet.  It was fun seeing that number quadruple this week, but at the end of the day it's only a few hundred dollars.",1636026155,hj9qkib

This, you can collect and count votes using a simple interface where you sign and use your NFT(s) to do so. You just need to creat a web interface with voting data that produces the message to be signed, which can then be submitted as your vote. They can count the number of NFTs you own (if it’s representing actual share count as 1:1) and then you get votes to count.

Honestly, it’s a pretty simple procedure from a coding perspective (generically). The part where there is the twist is having the experience of working with NFT and blockchains to be able to use the underlying language and APIs to generate the message to sign from the blockchain side of things.

Since it’ll be done on LRC, the fee would be virtually nothing, and GME could even potentially reimburse transaction fees (though the transaction fees would be incredibly low).

Also, the fees for doing that are likely lower than paying a company/service repeatedly to handle those votes through their softwares.

Eventually, it would see significant cost savings, IMO.",1636939915,hknydo5

Not a whale by any means, but I'd like to have xx GME being processed for DRS by year's end.",1636901040,hklbzx9
Ah. That does make sense. Seeing LRC go apeshit because of GME is a great advertisement.,1636900784,hklbglq
I agree LRC is ready to go now which is why he talks about it but listen carefully he quickly diverges to fully capable cross chain compatible roll ups. Do as you wish with your money I’m literally pointing out that Vitalik himself is the one pushing the conversation to cross chain compatible roll ups,1636900534,hklaxk3
Guy they hired from LRC knows about bonds so I disagree,1635384786,hibr4un
"Welp up to 500 shares already drs’d and 5,000 lrc (loopring) tokens. Let me know when to activate the thrusters, not touching until after 10 years, when gme/loopring own the meta verse and a majority of ether level 2 transactions worldwide. 🚀 ✌️",1635359677,hia2hcn
"That’s a great basic explanation!! A couple questions, if you don’t mind? Is there a best/worst exchange to make crypto purchases? I’m on Gemini which seems user friendly and not unlike RH. But that also makes me nervous that they aren’t actually transacting on my behalf? I hear people say “not your keys, not your crypto.” What does that mean in practicality? That I should be transferring any of my assets from the exchange where I purchased them into a wallet that I own? Either cold or hot? Asking because this potential partnership between GME and LRC has me excited about the future direction of both, and I want to make sure that I am being smart about the way I purchase and hold my assets.",1635349989,hi9duz4
Have no money since june. Sold 50% of my SHIB for LRC now,1635326973,hi86zlu
"I think it is normal that when BTC and ETH drop, all other tokens like LRC also drop,  as they are somehow correlated. Of course it is not a 1:1 correlation.

A single 10% drop on cryptocoins is not a signal for us apes, we have seen drops much frequent and stronger than this. I am still zen and DRSing.",1635322874,hi82bow
"Yes , very much so . Most of the time no one reads my comments so I throw out my extremes. A partnership between GameStop and let’s say Loopring/LRC for example, would be the first step similar to what DraftKings and Polygon/Matic just did in creating a platform for NFT’s . As for my 2 cents , I’ll be holding GME until we get to that “Oasis” where we finally get to witness true decentralization from everything we couldn’t even think about. Possibilities are endless when you switch from a society that works to compete and beat each other down to one that embraces collaboration and works to build each other up. Kinda like what this whole movement is about.",1635302705,hi77pah

So loopring is a technology company essentially. The gme marketplace doesn’t specifically need the $lrc coin. The gme marketplace is just a customer for loopring. Loopring uses lrc in theirnliquity marketplaces and it is also essentially a vote in their DAO,1635293262,hi6mz3c

"Yes. Loopring and GameStop haven’t officially announce partnership but it’s way too obvious to ignore at this point given all the hints we’ve been gifted. 

Loopring is absolutely going to skyrocket when this partnership is publicly acknowledged and we all learn what they’re actually planning to do with this platform. LRC is still a gamble coin right now until all of this is made public. 

That said, I’m a new Loopring HODLer. Just in case this is the coin they decide to use. 

After all, Matt Finestone said he was bringing millions of user back to Loopring in his resignation letter. That was enough for me. 😬",1635282320,hi5xw47

"80%, only cause there is obviously a fight to be the first to entertain zKRollups / optimal rollups on the L2 + networks, bringing gaming to the blockchain. The thing is Loopring isnt the only legitimate L2 scaler offering faster settlement times and a healthy infrastructure; however, they are likely chosen due to Cohen knowing the creator of loopring, having the old loopring creator work as Head of blockchain at gamestop, etc. it's highly likely GME is working with LRC to bring content creators, large game companies, and the best game companies, to Gamestop's L2 Marketplace. 

We won't know until they tell us, that's the secret spice.

For all we do know, it could be a completely different L2 project group Game Stop is working with, but if you do the research, and look through the other L2 scaler projects, almost none of them line up with Loopring's updates and release of said marketplace they're helping create, nor has any other group hinted to superstonk or gamestop that they are working on a gaming style marketplace on the L2 network.",1635280518,hi5t8jl

"We don't give financial advice here, we just like the stock. However, I will say that unlike GME, LRC is not shorted many times the float, where eventually every single short position will have to be repurchased. Additionally, a group of independent individuals is not collectively making the same decision to buy up LRC in an attempt to buy every coin that should exist, with the intention to never sell enough that the supply demand curve of said commodity never finds an intersection.

"Sure, but this post by Matt Finestone (GameStop's Head of Blockchain) makes a partnership with Loopring seem a bit more likely:


""Thank you, Loopring
Matthew Finestone - Apr 5

Yesterday was my last day acting as Head of Business for Loopring.
 . . .
So what’s next. I am not leaving Loopring because I am tired of it, or because I am not interested in its future. I think you may see from my sappy message above, that is not the case. The fact is, an opportunity has presented itself that I am extremely excited about, and I feel I simply must take. I view it as a once-in-a-lifetime, perfect-timing, far-reaching opportunity/challenge that I need to pursue for its own sake, and for my personal development.
 . . .
I will remain an advisor for Loopring. And not just the symbolic kind, but the real kind. I still hodl LRC, own equity in Loopring Technology Limited, and look forward to remaining part of Loopring’s bright future.

Thank you all for reading,
Matthew""

LRC trades on KuCoin as well. I bought some there,1635120249,hhxdley

For sure the LRC value will rise a bit after the annoucement. But don't expect too much of it. True and sustainable value in LRC will exist after a certain amount of markets will be built on Loopring.

"If a major retailer is using Loopring as a platform related to something like a NFT marketplace, not even talking about something as revolutionary as an NFT-stock-share platform, that would be gigantic. 

It'd be kinda like GameStop saying they're going to only exclusively buy Dell computers, replacing then all in every store right now, and again, annually, for the foreseeable future. Dell's value would go up.

 Considering Open Sea, which sells NFTs, is on track to do more $$$ business than eBay in the coming year/s (already they're doing billions; the growth is astonishing; NFTs are going to be big, big, BIG) - if GameStop came out with NFT markets they'd be making money hand over fist, using the LRC token, which is required for the platform to run, thus giving it (more, compounding) value. Take the Dell example and multiply it by... a lot.",1635114600,hhx21ct
"Yes there will be staking. The idea behind the LRC token is that as Loopring grows there will be more and more activities for which the user will have to pay fees: buy/sell orders, swaps, lending....

Well wallets are specific to the krypto you are storing.  A wallet stores the keys to your assests on the block chain and your wallet has a specific address for sending and one for recieveing.

"LRC is a governance token for Loopring. Level 2 from  Loopring is on the Ether chain. The NFT market will run on Ethers chain via the lvl 2 Loopring protocol to facilitate low gas fees which is one of the main issues of other market and cyrpto applications rn. Tokens that are not governance keys will be able to be minted on lvl 2 loopring but ultimately have ether at its core if that makes sense I'm kinda watering things down (my understanding is also budding so please comment if I got somethingwrong with my explanation).

The market place itself will be owned by the company who bought the lvl 2 utilization infrastructure from Loopring and built upon it. NFTs can be minted within this structure that are owned by the company who controls it not Loop. LRC has say on voting for the overall Loopring protocol it would have secondary influence on the marketplace only via voting on improving the original foundation of Loopring itself, such as issuing more governance tokens or burning some.

What OP is doing is exchanging directly swapping on the eth blockchain which is currently exceptionally expensive to do. But as I understand the cost doesn’t go up with the value of the swap. iirc the fee to swap 1 token to another, or 100,000,000 to another, it’ll cost the same gas fee. 

The gas fee is paid between to the miner of the transaction. LRC, and every other token, doesn’t get any part of *gas fee*.

I don’t think so but it’s the least far-fetched among the “good faith” reasons I can surmise. 

In the CC forum, has hype blown up on other coins and mention of them was halted for a time? Kind of like a breaker going off? If there has been no Reddit breaker with other hyped coins - only GME-LRC - then this is very suspect. This is not pump and dump though.

"Your numbers are wrong and you use different bases which does not make for a great comparison when talking about transactions per second. 

Not a massive deal but really suboptimal for a post that tries to educate, so here goes:

1) Idk where you've taken ETH being able to handle 30 TPS, most sources I find quote a number of around 13 TPS (might just be me being wrong)

2) You talk about transactions **per second** with BTC and ETH and then compare it to mastercard's transactions **per minute**, inadvertently painting a worse picture for L1 because it skews the numbers to make mastercard look that much bigger. Mastercard equals 66.66 TPS or if you'd like to go the other way around, BTC has 420 (nice) transactions per minute and ETH has 780 or 1800, depending on which TPS you look at.

3) LRC will be able to handle 4000 TPS right now with ETH 1.0 [as was stated here on the 10th of November](https://i.redd.it/yuiq1bae6ry71.png), however in that convo it also show that **once ETH 2.0 hits that figure will increase** by several orders of magnitude, which is likely where you pull that 400k from.

"You don't really need to go the ""easiest"" route - sometimes best to go a bit steeper learning curve and end up knowing a lot more right off the bat (like learning how to trade doing limit buys and sells on Kucoin for example). All depends what you want to do and how aggressive your trading strategy. It looks pretty scary at first, but you will learn the basics pretty quick - especially because you are now a more evolved ape since January who has learned about limit orders for your GME and already know how to sell limit orders when the time is right (MOASSSSSSS). 

I've not used Coinbase, but they would be an easy onramp. You can get your fiat currency into the crypto space and then move it around from there. You will learn that you will need multiple wallets and exchange accounts depending on what cryptos you want to buy.

Binance works well - can e-transfer fiat funds from your bank (Even RBC in Canada :-p ) and trade cryptos within the app. Can also stake them there too if you have some you are holding for the medium/long haul.

Get a cold wallet. Trezor or Ledger. if not - ensure you have a wallet that you have the 12/24 word keyphrase for. Not your keys, not your coins.

Crypto is a helluva ride with lots of ups and downs. If you love what you have been feeling with the GME roller coaster - you will find that rush in crypto. 

You will need a Metamask wallet too - and oh yeah - be prepared for some crazy fees along the way due to Ethereum Gwei/gas fees...

The moment I'm done writing this - I am going to attach my Metamask wallet to Loopring L2 in search of the fabled much lower fees :-)

You don’t get your NFT without a LRC burn rate et al…

From an article written by Loopring;

“To ensure the LRC token is coveted and provides real utility to the network, we will continue to incorporate LRC throughout the Loopring L2 ecosystem until we transition to our end state — being governed by LRC token holders by way of the Loopring DAO.”

This is the most basic version of a amm. Things are starting to change now. We'll see what kind do of features they implement. It's possible to have limit orders on a amm. 1inch does it.

""So what’s next. I am not leaving Loopring because I am tired of it, or because I am not interested in its future. I think you may see from my sappy message above, that is not the case.

I view it as a once-in-a-lifetime, perfect-timing, far-reaching opportunity/challenge that I need to pursue for its own sake, and for my personal development.


 I cannot give more information at the moment, but I will be sure to do so when the time is right — I hope on the order of a few months. This opportunity will keep me firmly in the blockchain (Ethereum) space, so I hope to be seeing many of you around real soon :).

"Loopring is welcome but that ""ohh look at the LRC token going to the moon, lets all invest in LRC"" is not the target. If people sell GME to get into LRC it will end badly for LRC as it will turn into a classic pump and dump and it will fuck up the MOASS by giving SHFs and MMs back shares to rehypothecate.

It's the classic divide and conquer that shills started with popcorn, silver and those other stocks and it's the same with LRC with the only difference that it appears to be friendly and connected to GME.",1636543688,hk20y0i

My personal opinion (not financial advice) is that this will probably not happen during this market cycle, but maybe half of that might be realistic. I could be totally wrong tho, since the big crypto run up is just starting it seems like.

 Which is it? $GME only? Or $GME and related topics? LRC is a related topic. Does that mean it's allowed? But it's not $GME. Does that mean it's not allowed?

 Personally, I think ""GME only"" language is outdated. We all know that DRSing GME is the play. We need to talk about other tickers to be ready post MOASS.

Just because we talk about x y z doesn't mean anyone thinks you should buy it if you don't want.

That's up to you.

If you're so easily swayed by someone merely mentioning other investments you need to go back and read the DD. If you're so annoyed to see other subjects that are not 100% GME, you need to go back and read the DD. If you don't understand why  some.subjects like Chinese stocks, supply chain issues and the reverse repo information is talked about, you need to go back and read the DD.

Which is going to send the GME shorts straight to Saturn (where we meet them).",1636535968,hk1roqu
"What does this mean exactly? 

Is this about moving my LRC to cold storage i think its called",1636535606,hk1ra6d
"We don't allow other investment talk besides GME. ""buy LRC"" is waaay out of line.",1636535257,hk1qw2x
"Alright, at first I could understand the LRC hype, it was interesting and potentially something

But now there are CLEAR SHILLS spouting it every single day

MODS MODS MODS

Something needs to be done at this point",1636534867,hk1qgjy
"We don't need to shill coins but if you're a long time GME Ape it would do you well to research Loopring and LRC since it is all but 99.99% confirmed to be the backbone of whatever Gamestop's marketplace will be.  

I'm a December 2020 Ape who's DRS'd and haven't sold a single share to go into LRC but I've taken a significant chunk of extra money and put into it and am up about $70k in a few days.  Anyone who tells an APE not to go make significant money for themselves on the system Gamestop will be using (that they can then use on GME shares if they so choose) is not a good person.",1636534492,hk1q18t
"I could have bought $600 worth of LRC @ $0.43c a week or so ago, instead I bought 3 more GME shares.   


Whilst I could have made a fuck load of money short term, I'm happy and will sleep well knowing my investment in GME will return a greater amount and make a world of difference, maybe not in the short term like LRC, but maybe tomorrow or the day after... 💆‍♂️",1636534480,hk1q0r6
"Okay, LRC talk is *seemingly* allowed but in the context of GME.

The amount of downvotes should tell you that the users aren't allowing it otherwise.",1636534458,hk1pzve
What date do we expect the announcement of the nft platform and partnership with Loopring LRC? Do we have any fancy dates coming up?,1636534261,hk1prn7
In the loop subreddit there’s a post that shows images from all over the meta verse apartment. Lots of books with interesting titles and there’s an LRC display in the room too amongst other stuff.,1640903691,hqlthh8

"I’ve been saying for days - nike, RTFKT, gmr, lrc. It’s a thing. And going to be big .. I posted about it 2 days ago but got downvoted and made fun of.",1640902234,hqlpvn0
"I believe it has something to do with the 5 million shares sold in June 21, to which is tied an agreement that if GME decides to buy back those shares, but the DTCC cannot provide them (gross oversimplification), then GME has the right to withdraw entirely from the NYSE and (oversimplification remember) go anywhere they see fit.  

By DRSing our shares, we make sure that if GME migrates its shares to another place, our shares will remain untouched. Those who did not, may see their shares liquidated by their brokers through various excuses.  
Sure it'd be illegal, and you could sue, but they cheated once, what's preventing them from doing it again? They have no shame.

The theory wants that Loopring has a role to play and that those guys are creating the next step in DeFi by setting up a decentralized stock market, but that's beyond speculation.  
We know there's an NFT marketplace, we believe that GME is going to partner with LRC for that marketplace (no confirmation yet).  

I know that the future is going to be interesting.",1640901540,hqlo52h
"And yet LRC is down, just gonna hodl.",1640900608,hqllrmp
"If I'm an independent musician, can I bypass the current distro environment and release directly on the blockchain via LRC and GME?  Can I collab with graphic artists to produce unique releases with their own unique artwork?  What is possible?",1640900603,hqllr98
"You're right, my bad

That 0.3% is the fee rate for the liquidity pool he appears to be participating in. LRC/WETH is the pool.",1640899844,hqljtpg
ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE BOOKS GO FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. STARTING WITH BLACK WHEN GME WENT BLACK? THERE IS THE NEXT LEVEL WITH LRC THAT BEGAN DURING THE TIME WHEN GME WAS BLACK?,1640899809,hqljqi7
The LRC team removed the milestones on GitHub. Someone said they are done or gave up 🤞😅,1640899694,hqljg1d
What about LRC/WETH 0.3%,1640899241,hqliale
"Its site wide, not sub rules.

Also it does seem gme and even lrc are havin the rules enforced harder than Ive ever seen",1640898328,hqlfz10
"Now imagine LRC at GME prices.

Bet that makes your titties tingle",1640896730,hqlbwlh
"Does this mean if any goods utilize NFTs, the ones providing the service and goods, will actually be properly compensated for this?

I applied for this job and my job contract NFT states $25 per hour, protected time off, no contact during off days, and paid family leave.

My surgery consent NFT says no tubal ligation.

This new car contract NFT says no contact for fucking extended warranty.

My voted ID NFT already verified and completed the process.

My single for this new album NFT gets me 0.05% royalty fees paid thru LRC.

My directly registered NFT minted stocks have available dividends thru stablecoin every 30 days.

What. The. Fuck.

No wonder NFTs are heavily demonized by media and condensed into an ugly ass pixelated image file.",1640890520,hqkvy7h
Well he is participating in the LRC/WETH pool not some other pool,1640890274,hqkvazd
That 0.3% is the fee rate for the liquidity pool he appears to be participating in. LRC/WETH is the pool. Nothing special.,1640888705,hqkr6gv
The 0.3% would be the exchange rate of LRC/WETH and in effect LRC/ETH. Is it a live ticker? Does the number change?,1640886843,hqkm94e
"So now the question is why is it there? and what does the 0.3% represent 

In my opinion, the fact that there is LRC on display proves again a partnership between GME and LRC.",1640884673,hqkggxe
"LRC is Loopring's ERC-20 token, just looked up WETH, here is what it says ...

""Wrapped ETH, or WETH, is a token that represents ETH 1:1 and conforms to the ERC20 token standard. By conforming to ERC20, it allows for increased functionality across any application that handles ERC20 tokens. You can always convert your WETH to ETH 1:1 and vice versa.""",1640884471,hqkfxe1
"Well the most obvious one would be LRC / WETH no idea what WETH is 

LRC is Loopring? There is also maybe a wallet code on the corners? What is that? 

Also we can see it is at 0.3% maybe if we check in a week or whatever that number will change and the official release of the NFT marketplace will be once that number is 100% 

Also I see a diamond on a book",1640884255,hqkfcu2
"Not once did i say buy LRC. Just stating that GME probably made a huge profit if they purchased Loopring coins pre squeeze for a future marketplace launch on their platform. 

I'm all in GME. But you can't ignore the GMExLRC connections. There is so much pointing in this direction... If i had some money left, i would have bought some pre squeeze though",1640883947,hqkejoa
"Given LRC marketcap at the time, and when they probably bought, it still would mean Gamestop would not project to ever dip into the second share offering equity.  The tokens are not that expensive.",1640883122,hqkce6u
Something I’ve been wondering. What if GameStop delists and moves onto their own market place. Is that possible? What would that look like? Instead of issuing stocks they issue tokens similar to LRC tokens. I’ve read so much on here but can’t recall if that’s been discussed.,1640882559,hqkax4h
"I never said you can't share your opinion. Do you really think the board decided to do a secondary offering without a plan or reason to do it? 
I already mentioned what I believe they did, they bought a shit load of LRC token in order to use their protocol. We will see that reflected in the next qtr report.",1640882475,hqkapba
"Very short-sided thinking. Scale and Growth. That's what the company needs now. For the same reason they secured a $500 million credit facility, Gamestop was wise to have dollars on board.

Those dollars likely bought a ton of Loopring Crypto at approximately 40 cents per token against a now cost of $2+ per token (based on the price of LRC surging a day after the last quarter ended). 

Cash on hand allows the company to maneuver easily to achieve SCALE and GROWTH which provides maximum long-term shareholder value.",1640880392,hqk5gt2
There are a few other I know of. Argent and Immutable X. Neither have links to gme like lrc does though.,1640878533,hqk0y36
"Instead of a one time dividend, GameStop could set aside 10% of Marketplace profits for a direct kickback to shareholders. Possible in LRC/ non-fiat currency to keep it cheap and fast.",1640874380,hqjrod2
"As this isn't real it could spread FUD, this would have been detrimental at the time when LRC was first being considered for a partnership and could be detrimental in the long run when there are other suspected partnerships.",1640874089,hqjr2h4
"meanwhile LRC: ""Lets mention our secret partner in our open source repo, nobody will know""",1640873439,hqjpqfq

Exactly - they keep trying to spread this garbage and try to inflate LRC even more.  What a joke this sub has become.,1640867076,hqjelwl
So why the LRC affinity rumor? Seems to me Matt’s a no body in this narrative if all he does is drive ops.,1640865245,hqjbyxt
no one knows. but if they want to keep the low gas fees they would be based on lrc or something very much the same.,1640865069,hqjbqa8
I did buy lrc though lol,1640862329,hqj81wi

"Here is the only fact that matters regarding OpenSea:

It has no name brand recognition. 

Everyone has heard of GameStop. We all know someone who shopped there or still does or do ourselves, yadda yadda.

Crypto is new and scary to the normies and boomers. 

So were vidya games, member? GameStop normalized that shit for the boomers so they could better spend money on little Johnny Dumbcunt. Gift cards are always an easy buy. 😏 See where I'm going yet? No? Fucking retarded! ✋High five! 

So, if crypto is the new ish and *iTs ScArY* for being too complicated... What if a brick-and-mortar company - one with a VERY *well established name* - could make it easy to get Johnny's daughter, Susie Fucksrightoff, a Crypto Gift card so she can buy some NPPs or 'whatever they're doing these days'.

Tl;Dr/Ts;Nw - Brick and mortars help normalize consumers to new shit. Always someone in a shirt there you can ask to explain it to your wife's boyfriend; someone's gotta buy the gift cards cause all your money is in LRC/GME, right? This is especially true if it's a name brand they trust *and have been buying at for years*. 

::drop mic::🎤

💥💥💣🧨🤯

🚀🚀🚀🚀

Bonus points if the platform integration feeds directly off the gift card purchase. I recall they set up a fiat ramp, eh? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",1640860508,hqj5p9u

"This has the potential to be a fully customized personal space where you can buy/trade/sell/display games. NFTs could be earned through normal play and achievement hunting, with varying degrees of scarcity. Music can be bought and played in-game or on any virtual radio. Mods and skins can be created in an open market. Tip the modder directly with digital currency. Imagine how much money a modder can earn from fixing a Bethesda game! I just fixed Fallout 4 VR on my PC and I would gladly tip the modders some LRC, for instance. And they made the mods in 2018, so they still could be earning residual income. Managing finances, buying and selling crypto and stocks...endless possibilities, from the comfort of your own space in this virtual world. The ecosystem will rely heavily on Power Up Rewards members adopting this and creating a healthy ecosystem. Keep an eye out for baby steps, like NFT integration with Funko Pop (real and virtual collections mixing togetger). This current NFT submission project is just the starting point, the seed to a larger vision. Drawings of apes and cats is not the end game. The future is pooping in a purple ring in the metaverse.",1640856426,hqj0jig
LRC? Ugh,1640854301,hqixult
So… buying more GME and LRC? Gotcha! 😎,1640850250,hqisjzc
"I feel like LRC is heavily manipulated by big money (as well as all crypto) 

LRC had a liquidity issue a few weeks ago and yet nobody talks about it anymore.

Just a thought",1640842666,hqigump
"I feel like \~allegedly next LRC and GME would collab on the results of the stress test to see if they are in spec while at GameStop they may have a team filtering NFT Marketplace applications till they have the numbers in the categories they want to begin the rollout of creator accounts (at launch). when that's at status green creators may be able to start to populate the marketplace. (i've got a set waiting id like to mint a lunch personally ) Not to sure what timeframe this is in but once this is in motion I think the next steps on this foggy staircase will come up.

Notable future things: New years, CES 2022, Loopring subreddit seems to be still awaiting the official announcement of the big marketplace partner, sneeze anniversary with a shit ton of open interest jan 21 options(probably nothing... but if a lot of yearlies get thrown around/rolled it could be highly volatile maybe, idk) 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this is the quantum universe where we stopped mark zuckerburb from making ready player one a reality to trap everyone in the matrix leaving the world free for him to roam and collect all existing bottles of sweet baby rays and ribs for his green egg; by enabling RC to make an actually good metaverse that's cool and not zuckerburg mind jail where he sells your thoughts to Johnson and Johnson, raytheon, and apple. 

but I dont know",1640840615,hqid3rk
That was Akari when LRC was being mentioned here. I bought at .54 the first time I read about it and in the few days following it really took hold in the sub. Not saying Gamestop wasn't part of it. Probably wise to jump in once they say it popping off here.,1640835390,hqi2fx1

Crypto guy? maybe he should look into LRC. It ties in with the metaverse GameStop is building. Brain too smooth to know how but it’s worth a mention.,1640826416,hqhiai6
"You're not alone. My LRC wallet account was verified and I've now tried to purchase Eth with 3 different major credit cards. All have failed today.

"? All of the evidence had Loopring's fingerprints on it, and none of it has even the slightest GameStop DNA on it. And from there there are third parties that rehash things.

Now imagine for a second that Loopring is a scam, should we believe their evidence? GameStop sure as fuck isn't saying anything. GameStop hasn't said shit. GameStop isn't running around dropping clues about Loopring and LRC because, get that, they are not in on whatever Loopring is trying.

Here is a quote of you saying the exact opposite of what you just said now....",1640816526,hqgupn9
How's the LRC promotion going?,1640815440,hqgrzah
"I own a lot of GME so I can participate here as much as I like

You are the own being a troll about some Movie Stock corporate move in Kansas

Meanwhile GME is still treating its workers very badly but you are hiding it under the carpet and pretending how a company treats its employees is somehow not important while a company moving from one part of a city to another somehow is

************

I will repeat - I own GME so I can speak freely on this sub without some idiot like you telling me to leave

I am not anti GME

I am anti tiny dick GME shareholders who need to attack other stock to feel good about themselves

and the white knights like you that think that is acceptable behavior

If these paranoid anti LRC anti Movie stock 'everyone is against us' cunts were not here then we would have a lot more new people join in, instead of getting scared off

Btc will get to 500k based adoption models. Lrc and gme could flop this whole nft market place. I think some people don't understand that ryan cohen isn't a god and gme's revival isn't guaranteed. I love the guy but he is only human and he is up against the whole entire financial world,1640810077,hqge37e
And I didn't create it to troll or anything so what's the problem of being a new member? I joined Reddit because of the firearm subs but I also was a little into crypto. This whole lrc and gme rumor blew up and I got in probably early November. My order is genuine and I'd down vote my experience too. Hate the messenger. Lol,1640809810,hqgdeas
What's the easiest way to buy lrc if I'm at ground zero for cc,1640809466,hqgcilt
"It's not frustration

It's sadness

Lots of groups of people are fighting THE EXACT SAME PEOPLE

whether you are in

GME

or

Movie Stock

or

Crypto-Coins

or

DeFi

all wars are Banker Wars

against the people who control the petro dollar

It's sad that one group are so @#$#@ elitist and so @#$@#$ stupid that they think LRC is a distraction and cryp-to coins are a distraction and everything except one stock is a distraction

If there was no war except for GME, it would be over within 1 month

and GME would not win that war",1640809130,hqgbn5b
"Well, you have to keep the stable coin starting with ""Tet"" in mind. While Blockchain technology is awesome, there is a lot of pump and dump and scam, when it comes to coins and tokens.

I do no longer discuss that stuff with crypto investors anymore, though. Everybody is responsible for his own investment decisions. The info is out there.

Nonetheless I find it beyond stupid from a risk reward perspective to invest money into btc compared to other coins/tokens with potential. I think it is a no-brainer, that for example LRC is more likely to reach 20 USD compared to btc reaching 500k - both would be 1000% ROI.",1640809087,hqgbj9k
"No I do not

I talk shit about GME shareholders (a small and loud segment, mind you) who are so insecure they are always on Movie Stock subs spreading FUD

**************

This group of GME shareholders are such bitches that they are being paid shills for SHFs and not even taking payment. If Movie STock and AA are going to live rent free in your heads, and you are going to Movie Stock subs and LRC sub bad mouthing them, at least take some SHF bitcoin like a few of your fav DD writers

at least that way you get paid and can buy more GME",1640809013,hqgbcck
"But there was a month long shilling campaign!

You got to give them some face! Go give Loopring a bunch of ETH and they'll legit give you their very own LRC!

yeahhhhh",1640808439,hqg9v52
I support both gme and lrc so I have no hate towards GameStop but my order was botched too.. I ordered a 3 pack Eevee evolutions plush set on 12/10 for my daughter and I received the package on 12/17 and I only received the glaceon so I contacted them and they made me a return label so I returned the product and now they're telling me since they already processed my replacement they cannot cancel my order and refund me but also the product is no longer sold they are out for the foreseeable future. Since they cannot replace my item or refund me cash they opted for points but I honestly just want my cash back but they're telling me to fk off. Lol,1640808435,hqg9uru
"Thanks OP. Reading through all of this helped make everything click. This is pretty close to a smoking gun, imo. One caveat being, as you mentioned, some malicious attempt to mislead people by faking a line of GameStop the first time (and possibly trying to excuse it by saying ""it wasn't me"" due the the unverified fork phrasing). But as you've pointed out, too many similarities. So IF that is what's going on, they will lose a ton of credibility and LRC will tank.

I still think it's GameStop for sure though. And the recent use of ""marketplace"" on GameStop's official NFT page just further cements it. Only a time traveler, like you said, would've known that was GameStop's intent and that GameStop would use that specific word when making up some fake news to pump their coin with the Q3 report. So yeah, pretty unlikely. Now we wait.",1640808243,hqg9cp9
Are they shorting LRC too? Lmayo,1640807969,hqg8muz
"Okay theory is pretty simple. After trading sideways between $0.3 to $0.7 for months, LRC squeezed without an obvious catalysator. 

1) Gamestops third Quarter happens to end 1 day prior on 10/30/21.

2) Daniel Wang, CEO and Founder of Loopring, tweeted a chinese poem about a sword that has been sharpened for years and is ready for use. [Tweet here](https://twitter.com/daniel_loopring/status/1455348339101208577)

3) Leaks in the Github code have been further indicating a LRC x GME partnership",1640807294,hqg6w1o

Yes. You buy ETH and then trade it for LRC if you want to,1640806063,hqg3q81
"Again, so why post about the L2 wallets and LRC here?  lol 

I’d rather buy GME.",1640805461,hqg25w8
"How does one purchase LRC on L2?

Do you have to give them ETH and they give you LRC?",1640805455,hqg25aw
"Yeah, I had a brain fart.

I do not believe GameStop and LRC are related",1640805144,hqg1com
What happens when a non-stop daily barrage of LRC shilling meet DEEZ?,1640804821,hqg0izc
Technically LRC can be manipulated by them manipulating ETH but doing that will leave their fingerprints all over it,1640804733,hqg0atq
"What happens when an unstoppable stock (GME) meets an unshortable object (LRC)?

MOASS.",1640804679,hqg05o3
"The difference is that no one is coming to Superstonk suggesting that apes buy Evergrande, whereas Loopring Shills have infiltrated to the point that mods allow open SHILLING of LRC on absolutely ZERO credible news regarding a partnership.",1640803893,hqfy4aw
Why is everyone commenting about tHeIr wAlLeTs here and not the LRC sub?,1640803186,hqfw9my
"Can't be proven yet.

I also appreciate OPs hype but all LRC association is unconfirmed still.",1640802302,hqftyi0
"I got into it early on before I really dove into GME's DD.  So yeah, the proportions are reeeeally off lol.  But I expect to be xx within the next couple weeks and will keep growing the GME position from there.  My personal plan is not to buy more movies, and just stick with expanding my positions in GME and LRC after the research I did.",1640802054,hqftbgb
There’s really no need.. they have ETH and LRC supporting their applications,1640801807,hqfso6z
"I haven't had a rando speculation in a while.  


GameStop will announce its collaboration with LRC and the marketplace will be launched this week.     


They will not be releasing a metaverse platform.  As awesome as that would be, I think that there are already other players out there doing it and doing it well - the money is not in creating a ""game"" as I sort of view the Metaverse digital space, but instead on being the conduit for all things found inside all metaverses.     


I think GameStop will be releasing a marketplace that can be tied to a couple of different existing companies/platforms like Decentraland who already have a few, but not many, marketplace partners established.  


I also think they've got a partnership with Grayscale where they will be establishing some of their Crypto trading through a defi platform hosted by GME/LRC.   I think this is why their PFPs are all grayscale and what they are building toward.  It's not just the profile picture, though this was linked to ""an announcement"" that hasn't been made yet.   But if you need more speculation, the first article I found on Grayscale had this in it.  


""Andrew Left of Citron Research has publicly criticized the Grayscale Investment Trust, and Citron has tweeted that GBTC is the ""most dangerous way to own Bitcoin.""""",1640799995,hqfny7u
"Benzinga and Bloomberg were the ones that ""broke the fake news"" (with an AA photoshopped tweet for fucksake) then came back later and said they couldn't confirm it. It's not a popcorn ape brigading campaign that started this. The power that be are playing apes against apes with their shit narratives again, that's it. 

I own both and LRC (tri-stonkual?), and I think the synergy between the two w/ Gaming/Movie NFTs that run through the GME/LRC Marketplace is a no-brainer.",1640798519,hqfk2wt
"I mean we should hope GME charges a fee to do this, and that it’s both fair to creators/sellers while also profitable to GME (shareholders).

The LRC fee should be negligible since it’s L2",1640798055,hqfivcs
You close the app and never open it ever again or when lrc is at 99999999 usd,1640797943,hqfiktb
"The current web suffers from centralization. Recently was crashed and brought down services like Netflix, Spotify, multiple website and such. Blockchain is decentralized, if one server/node goes down the whole system goes down. More over while scalability has been an issue on the eth network, LRC aims to fix such issues. The benefit of such streamlining such services is really to delight the customer which brings value to their company. Just look at the gta remastered problem where the older game ran mods and the new remastered one does work with most older mods. If your trying to say making things cheaper won’t get people to spend ore I am sure marketers and advertising professionals would point to Black Friday sales. The main idea of blockchain technology is much like most new technology, to do things better faster and cheaper.",1640797794,hqfi6vo
"I mean I’m not exactly sure but:
Assuming the rumours are real and LRC is the partner, the incentive for the Platform is: People need LRC to mint / trade. So you need to buy LRC which causes the price to rise and therefore the company gets their cut in elevated market cap, no?",1640797725,hqfi0e7
Okay cool. Now I have 430 LRC and some left over ETH. And then?,1640797689,hqfhx1t
Cost $60 to deposit and withdraw. Might as well just dump it into LRC at this point,1640797622,hqfhqzx
"exchange the ETH for some LRC, i deposited 100e but it's not enough fml",1640797509,hqfhgdn
"The gas fees alone won't do it, currently opensea also offers some NFTs on (another chain) with fees comparable to LRC maybe slightly more. The UX of the marketplace is what needs to blow people out of the water",1640796266,hqfe87b
"""Net long"" means they have reported a greater long position than short positions, correct? They still hold short positions.

""The firm currently holds call options representing 7,148,000 of underlying shares valued at $272,053,000 USD and put options representing 5,014,900 of underlying shares valued at $190,867,000 USD"" - Fintel ( can't post the link cuz automod screamed at me )

They're a hedgefund, they hedge their positions. However, if it's believed that they're lying about their GME short positions, why should we trust their reporting on other short positions?

I'm not trying to convince anyone to do something like buy movies. I personally won't be buying anymore and have been putting my spare investment money towards GME and LRC because my god GME is gonna be the next huge tech giant. I don't wanna miss out on that.

I just want to explain my logic and how I've drawn my conclusions, and have people point out where the flaws are so I can learn more. It's not enough to just say ""sticky floor bad."" Tell me why because I've seen conflicting information.",1640795877,hqfd8io
"Didn't one of the Loopring Medium posts say they were working with exchanges to build LRC L2 integration into their exchanges? A lot of major exchanges allow you to deposit and withdraw both stablecoins and the primary layer tokens to L2 chains. Once that happens, the off-ramp solution is in place. All we need is for a major exchange to bite.",1640793423,hqf75u1
"I am not him, but I know of him.

I also know what happened to him when it was revealed he was wrong, and would gladly go the same way. 

But my thesis stays the same: LRC is just one of the many coattail riders that want to have our funds for their own purposes, and should not be in this sub.",1640792010,hqf3t63
And LRC is an affinity scam.,1640790638,hqf0o7o
"I have some LRC in a CEX, but that's just change that couldn't buy a share",1640789790,hqeyrv9
I’ve diversified my portfolio for the first time since liquidating for GME earlier in the year - I now hold a small sum of LRC on L2,1640789744,hqeyoao
That part got me confused but what I do understand (I think) is that gamestop wants to creat and nft trading marketplace. Which it would need something like lrc to be able to run this platform on. Lrc allows the transfers of nfts very quickly and efficiently and cheaply. This is how I understand it,1636008260,hj94xmm
So is this good for LRC as well?,1636007986,hj94lme
"Oh I have no problem with that... lol. ('cept that I'm female, but whatevs)

I play competitive poker. There's no difference - sometimes your hunch works, sometimes it doesn't. If you're not having fun on the roller coaster you need to step away, right? Lol Not worried about a $100 loss. I prefer my stonk with a side of DD. 

Sears could still pop up for some weird reason only hedgies understand. I'll just hang onto it. I put a few bucks on Loopring coin also, wondering if the potential connection between loopring and gme could work out to be beneficial for LRC in some weird way. It has rewarded me by almost tripling my money. That's fun to watch. Going to hold onto it until all this settles. I'd like to see the effects of a true catalyst like announcement of an nft stock exchange. Then I'd sell and buy more gme. 

😆",1636007060,hj93ha0
"Okay, just say it. Does this mean I should buy LRC?",1636006983,hj93dti
"LRC has got enormous potential. Tits, jacked.",1636006867,hj938ng
"So... we should be buying and holding the fuck out of GME and LRC? Got it... I now have two children. It is a shame I cannot DRS the LRC...

... it will be like sending one child to private school and sending one to detention! 😆",1636006205,hj92fb5
"Honestly I don't think the primary players in that runup were even GME apes. LRC is being heavily driven by crypto bros and traders who see the price go up and fomo in without any idea of what Loopring is.

Not saying apes haven't bought into it/moved their other crypto holdings into it, but it first boosted when the GitHub leaked happened, and then got more traction the following day from people buying in when it took over the headlines and was on top gainers. MOASS and GME aside LRC would have pumped hard on that news just within the crypto sphere.

I had a minimal amount left over in shitcoins that wasn't worth transferring out after all the fees to put in GME, so I moved it to LRC last week before it ran up. Side bet is the best way to play that, esp if it's just swapping coins. I won't be putting anything else into it, GME holds the key to my wallet lol, but curious to see what happens with the small amount I have.",1636005903,hj921mz
LRC started a month ago with the Glass Castle DD and Matt Finestine having worked there,1636005412,hj91f61
GME+LRC=DNYSE,1636005190,hj914vq
Just aped some LRC tokens. Gonna gnaw on some crayons and watch the show.,1636003608,hj8z0lb
So… DRS and buy LRC?,1636001487,hj8vy8i
"No, but LRC is a good investment if it fits you. And it's also in a dip right now!",1635998142,hj8qg2b
"I know most of you hate crypto or whatever, but I’m up 30x on my LRC investment. Shit is going insane!  I’m kind of caught up on the whole GME legend, but the fact that GameStop has partnered with Loopring has my *tits straight jacked*!",1635997954,hj8q472
"It's further confirmation of GameStop being partnered with Loopring to make some kind of NFT marketplace. 

LRC (LoopRing Coin) was a slip from me, it's a NFT by Loopring, basically a coin like ether and bitcoin to make it super simple.",1635997673,hj8plwz
Does this mean we need to buy LRC?,1635997613,hj8phvu
But what the fuck even is it? What is LRC? What it is?,1635997563,hj8pelo
"&gt; I’m not the right person for this but my understanding is that Loopring specializes in Defi. Loopring and LRC were designed specifically for this exact type of function.

My understanding is that Loopring and L2 are used to reduce the transaction costs to the point of being negligible per transaction, and have been doing so for many years.",1635997074,hj8oik6
But are all the benefits seen through specifically trading their LRC token currency? Or does that apply to ether tokens as well,1635995729,hj8lzam
"If LRC was a top 20 crypto it'd be ~ $12.00

If it was top 10 ~ $27.00",1635995025,hj8km0v
"I’m not the right person for this but my understanding is that Loopring specializes in Defi. Loopring and LRC were designed specifically for this exact type of function.

Cohen and Co are simply using the Gamestop brand to leverage Loopring technology and implement it with a real world business case.

They didn’t need to build the technology from scratch. Blockchain has existed since the 90s, crypto has evolved quickly over the past decade and Loopring tech was built specifically for DeFi.

Ryan Cohen just recognized it’s brilliance and has implemented a plan to bring it to mass users.",1635994952,hj8kgpy
Just bought a bunch of LRC. let's see what happens on Friday,1635994663,hj8jw1g
LRC &amp; GME 🚀🚀🚀,1635994568,hj8jpe8
LRC to the moon 🚀,1635994464,hj8jhzu

Thanks for the source! 🦍 History in the making.",1635993925,hj8iehg
Wtf is LRC?,1635993658,hj8hv28
i see LRC i upvote,1635993540,hj8hm4g
"Is coinbase safe? I seem to remember hearing some pretty RH kinda things about them. I used to use CB pro when I traded ether and bch, but you have to use BTC to buy LRC on pro.

So much headache.",1635993105,hj8gpd8
"&gt; I don't think it's a pumpndump. It seems to be a solid coin with people actually working on it. It's also holding around 1.15ish pretty hard. As long as the rumors are true, this could be big.

Well, yes and no.  LRC isn't a ""currency"" in the sense that some others are.  Unlike bee tee see you're not going to be able to use it to buy products (like buying an electric car from Elon).  Instead it's main purpose is to be used to pay protocol fees for transactions on their layer-2 rollups and, and for staking for individuals/groups that are running decentralized exchanges on Loopring.  It's sort of the fuel that Loopring transactions run on.

That being said, if Loopring launches an NFT marketplace with a major commercial partner, perhaps a retailer that is positioned to generate billions of dollars in transactions per year, then the utility of the token will increase, presumably along with the value.  I think that the ""pump"" we've been seeing this week is mainly due to GME apes discovering that LRC exists and thinking it's another way to hitch their wagon to a roket ship.  I'm not sure that it is.  

If you've read the DD you know that GME is going to have the mother of all short squeezes when it takes off.  I doubt that anything else in our lifetimes is going to take off like that, ever.  I think that LRC is positioned to go up, particularly if Loopring has a successful marketplace launch with their customer (presumably Gamestop) and can leverage that into further marketplace deals.  Who knows where the limit is after a couple of years, but whether LRC takes off and how much it is going to go up depends on how successful Loopring the company is at launching these markets.  OTOH, GME's takeoff is virtually assured to happen at some point, sooner or later.  Maybe a couple positive announcements get some firms into failed margin call territory.  Maybe the entire float gets direct registered, leading to a situation where the shorts are forced to close their positions.  Maybe the Gamestop board decides to withdraw everything from the DTCC and go to a different market altogether.  There are still a number of possible triggers, none of which hinge on the success of the company.  All Gamestop the company has to do is not go out of business, and eventually MOASS will happen.

To me, it's an interesting side bet, and a good opportunity to learn more about decentralized finance.  No matter what happens with LRC the token, the knowledge gained will be useful.",1635991827,hj8e04u
"I don’t think it’s a P&amp;D. LRC is tied to a legitimate company and isn’t some shitcoin. It is going to change the game in terms of ETH, gas fees, processing times, etc. plus, the current price is still well below the ATH. The movement this week is seemingly all hype, doesn’t seem coordinated at all especially with how close to the chest Loopring is playing everything.",1635991649,hj8dmil
"First I thought that was a given since they both are joined ? Second I wasn’t selling anyone on a damn thing , third if a GmE / LRC post is made I figured it’s probably a good time to get excited about owning the fuking combo ! 
Tell me to quit / only time I have ever ! 

Lastly WTF ? Why read about the LRC and be pissed about someone talking about it ?

If this was straight GME I’d wouldn’t have even brought it in to play ! 

Anyway Cheers with a serious wtf",1635991288,hj8cu9g
I didn't say it was but there is very savvy players on Reddit.   LRC and Gamestop currently are being connected...I am trying to figure out why LRC is lowering.   I am trying to make $$$ playing both sides...yes I am a new APE...only been here since January,1635991261,hj8cs5r
I’m a crypt0 amateur but bought LRC as soon as I saw the GitHub leak. Now patiently waiting for this partnership to get announced so I can pump my extra tendies into GME.,1635990212,hj8ah0b
I haven't heard that. Can you source where you heard specifically that the existing and currently trading LRC coin is related to GameStop?,1635990181,hj8aef2

In crypto, there's a general sentiment of 'not your keys, not your coin'. Basically unless your crypto is held in your own personal wallet, which only you know the seed phrase or key, then it's possible for you to lose access to your coins. Website gets hacked, exchange is shady, etc.

"No idea. Could be any one of these things:

* Sympathy squeeze due to Bee Bee Bee Why
* Institutions buying/selling due to the upcoming announcement. The timing is sus because if you remember GameStop was having meetings all over their locations yesterday, possible someone leaked something &amp; this is the effect.
* ETF failures to deliver being bought in. I think this is more likely because last night there was a finra lock in / market buy-in. When the market would open at 9:30 AM American time or it's normal schedule, at 4:00 PM (30 min before market close) that's when FINRA does it's FTD buy ins or buy ins for failed members. Since the market opening time has moved back by 1 hour, this FINRA buy in / lock in period is now 30 minutes AFTER the market closes. Look at last night's chart on the few popular meme stocks at 10:30 on the dot and see what happened.
* **Hypothetical with some Data:** The very limited data i have shows an interesting but yet to be proved pattern. This is a theory and nothing more right now, but the data shows that maybe on Monday, they cleared ETF FTDs worth a theoretical 1.4x, Tuesday 1.1x and Today they cleared 2.4x. Today was a larger buy event because they also bought FTDs that were pending to be bought tomorrow as a deadline which means tomorrow volume should be flat with a sprinkle of capitulation from paper hands. FRIDAY however shows that there's the possibility we'll see a 13x event, Monday is a 25x event and Tuesday is a 30x event. After that it's just small 1.4x events for another week or two. Let's see what happens over the next few days, depending on the results i'll consider my theory valid or not.
* **Theory:** Stock tokenization has started using LRC/Loopring for stocks moved to CS and this is the cause of what we're seeing.
* Last week on AMZN's earnings, something strange happened with AMZN &amp; the meme volatility variance basket. There's a chance someone had a big bet on AMZN and got wiped out and we're seeing their prompt liquidation this week. I think there's a good chance this happened because it all started on that night of AMZN's earnings.
* What this means for Nov 23 the next GME 90 day runup cycle? I'm still going to buy calls on the 19'th pending a runup on the 22n'd or 23'rd. It doesn't matter what the price is, i still think it'll runup even a tiny bit from where the price would be at that time. What's being traded here is not only GME shares, but the big boys are trading GME Volatility as a tradeable product, this is what swaps are used for. The theory is that someone is SHORT volatility for GME or the meme basket which means that they sold someone else a swap with an implied volatility STRIKE just like with options. The seller needs GME's volatility to be low and they get paid or pay the difference from the strike every 90 days. This is likely a multi-year swap contract which means whoever sold it is fucked for a long time because GME will keep doing this yoyo shit until the swap expiry. The swap payout is every 90 days hence why we runup on Feb, May, Aug, Nov \~the 23'rd ish or 2 business days after the 3'rd Friday of those months. There's a chance that the volatility we're seeing is them being unhedged on the call side after the 90 day expiry &amp; need to rebuild their replicating portfolio to hedge their variance swap which requires them to buy options at multiple and very specific strikes to keep the roof on this thing. Using this swap they don't even need to trade the underlying GME stock, they just hedge using the options and keep the price steady. This implies they are SHORT volatility which means they need implied &amp; historic volatility to be low e.g low volume days for a long time.... ring a bell?  


Yeah anyway there's a lot of shit this move could be. It could even be them manually doing the SLD period early instead of on the 23'rd of Nov. I realized it's possible to do this since SR-NSCC-801 got implemented, it gave them the ability to do this any time they want and not just every 90 days. This might be them de-risking themselves from now in order to deny us the 23'rd Nov runup after they realized we caught wind of every how often GME will go up.

Could literally be anything. I'm trying to figure this shit out. Only one thing is for sure though, the one easy way to get things going is for everyone to buy 1 ATM call. Everything is hedged except the middle, if you buy the middle / ATM or where the price is currently trading at, you fuck their hedge. This is how you can fuck the hedgies. Problem is that only a whale can do this or tons of people getting ATM options that are likely to end up worthless, but will still ignite the moass.",1635962995,hj6fwxe
"Interesting, I guess one way we could work it out would be to look at the volume of traded shares? A job for later I think, I'm still at work (lol, yeah right, I've been staring at GME/LRC all day).",1635962147,hj6docw
"It’s the general fun/hype of the last week before this week hit. November V for Vendetta reference, big game releases, NFT/LRC hype. And then bath towel &amp; other stocks afterhours activity yesterday blew up. Been a heckin’ week so far.",1635961143,hj6b0oa

Seriously. There's real teeth here. And the paranoia is crazy (like that comment above yours). And contrary to that paranoia ... LRC isn't just about GME. It's going to have a big future with the few layer 2 and side chain projects that lead the way with ETH. And that looks like Polygon and Loopring. So it doesn't just exist to be a pawn in a different economical ballgame. And certainly not to make a bunch of people on reddit sad. Jeez.,1635958283,hj63fg1
"I appreciate your kind words. I have to disagree though, RC did say that at the shareholders meeting but there have been no actions or words. The NFT marketplace you're referring to is actually speculation, the only thing that is confirmed is there is a link on GS's website that shows they are interested in it.

I understand the man may have a gag order until Feb 2022, but what about Matt Furlong or any of their marketing team? They are only playing on the free publicity from the apes by saying oops moass and other unhelpful distractions.

"The returns from GME will be much much higher than returns from LRC.


LRC market doesn't have any fuckery going on with them so an increase in demand will drive an increase in the price. Buying LRC now to sell it later for a 3x-5x requires at least one of two things to happen:

(1) Loopring does something that generates a lot of revenue so people feel comfortable buying LRC.

(2) People are hyped about LRC so you are able to sell your coins to someone who's willing to buy them at much higher prices.

The nice thing about buying GME is that SHFs are ensuring that the price remains pegged around 200-250 dollars no matter the demand.

I'll talk all day with you about the company and their technology, but don't push the coin on me and *definitely* don't tell me it's ""vital"" to anything. Buying LRC doesn't help GME go up and it doesn't help GameStop directly. There is no well-backed-up argument that says otherwise.

"If they become partners of GameStop, I would be happy, because it seems like a good protocol for making an L2 NFT marketplace, and this in part would enable creaters, collectors and players to create, share, transact, buy and sell all kinds of IPs like games, skins, DLCs, addons, characters etc.

Because of the nature of NFTs, each transactions will be made public, and everyone will get a cut.

This will stimulate immensely the value of my GME shares.

However, anyone giving low-gas fee/no gas fee L2 ETH capability would be suitable. I would actually prefer if it weren't a third party stationed in the PRC, as I have a long experience with the country and it does not make me feel at ease, what with the legal background of recent changes in the country. I feel it would be unsafe. 

I have nothing against Loopring per se, just the legal setting, and the incredible amount of pumpers who come here and argue with faulty logic, and try to make something that isn't a thing into a thing.

"\- Is it possible to mint NFTs from ERC-20 tokens? (Reasonably sure yes, but looking for confirmation from someone in the know)

\- In the event of a deflationary currency such as LRC reaching low supply, what's the logical move for systems that rely on it to maintain their long-term functionality?

\- How viable would a reversal of responsibilities for data handling be, utilising an NFT-centric system? And how might such a system work?

For context on that last set: Currently, websites, systems and businesses make users agree to their ToC and to various capacities surrender their rights to their personal data. When I speak of a reversal of responsibilities, what I have in mind is the user retaining full control and responsibility for their data through the use of an NFT-locked personal data archive. Any new contract utilising the user's information must be verified in a similar manner to coin/token transactions, and individual contracts can be cancelled by the owner of that NFT/data to revoke access at any time.

\- Lastly: Depending on how it's designed, is it possible that such contracts as described in the last point could automatically mark and trace accessed data in order to delete it when the owner revokes access to the other party?

"A hardware wallet is about as secure as you can go, aside from a pair wallet, and maintain liquidity.  Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and other crypto marketplaces are the simplest way to acquire crypto tokens and coins. I don't know of any NFTs available on a major marketplace, but related tokens are (LRC, XTZ.)

 If you're just dipping your toes into the water, Coinbase is a fine way to get started. It has a decent interface, a number of crypto to choose from, a simple way to buy at market, and easy ways to ""stake."" The stake is in quotes because you're not in full control of the token or choice of node. The fees are higher than necessary and you can't make buy / sell purchase orders, but that's the cost of simplicity.

From there, you can progress on to Coinbase Pro and a software wallet (I'm using TrustWallet.). At that point you're buying and selling on something that looks like an actual market. You can set but / sell prices and such. Most importantly, you have tokens on your own wallet.  It costs gas to get them there but you own them.

I personally like having a software wallet so I can plug into dApps to do things like smart contracts like Pancake Swap to buy clown coins or transfer from layer 1 to layer 2.  Trust Wallet has NFT support, but I have ventured in that direction yet because of gas fees.  It blows my mind NFT gas fees are so high when layer 2 applications are coming available. Layer 2 technology like Cosmos (ATOM), Cardano (ADA), Loopring (LRC), and Tezos (XTC) were developed with this type challenge in mind. There's a trade-off of security for liquidity.

I kinda wandered off there. I guess the thing I would say is if you know what Coinbase is and pair it with a wallet, don't shy away from it.  Don't keep your tokes on the marketplace wallet unless you want ultimate liquidity.  Transferring from a marketplace wallet to a personal wallet is basically DRS for tokens.  *Everything* has a fee / requires gas.  That's how proof of stake and work (BTC miners) get paid for running nodes.  TANSTAAFL",1635692334,hirqi9c

"Wallets.

The primary purpose of a wallet is to provide a link to s blockchain and record your transactions on the blockchain (buying, selling and or ownership of, for example, an NFT). Now, it's important to clarify that the wallet does not hold or store any tokens/NFTs, coins. Instead, those assets are recorded as transaction records on the blockchain ledger and distributed across hundreds/thousands of cloud nodes. So what does the wallet hold? Well, the wallet connects to the blockchain using a private and public key. And the wallet connects to or stores the encrypted private key. That brings me to my point. Wallets can broadly be separated into 2 types.

1)  Custodial Wallets

2)  Non-custodial Wallets

Custodial Wallet - WTF is that? 

Well, the simplest and easiest wallet to install and maintain is a custodial wallet on your mobile device. The custody bit tells you that the company that provides the wallet app keep custody of the private key for you and tie it/or link it, to your mobile device. You don't have access to the private key directly - it all just works in the background, super easy and fast to get going - great for noobs - just download and go. The disadvantages; not your keys not your crypto - so you don't, potentially have full control or arguably full ownership.  Fine for low-value everyday usage. You might think of this as buying stonk on an exchange other than CS. In essence, you really, really trust your app provider to stay in business, not fk up, not get hacked, etc. For example, I run a custodial wallet BTC lighting wallet on my phone - but I wouldn't trust it to with more than $50. 

Non Custodial - WTF is that? 

Well, this means you look after, secure and are responsible for your private key. There is no one to take custody of the private key for you, no technical support. You need to be tight on key phrase backups and maintain anti-malware security on your devices and, if you're going to store a decent value of crypto you probably need to invest $100-200 (ish) in a hardware wallet (something like Ledger Nano or Tresor) to secure the key and backup phrases safely offline - taking it online only when you need to make a transaction. You fk up, game over. 

OP mentioned Metamask. Metamask is a non-custodial web wallet - meaning you need to manage the keys and stuff which, as the OP pointed out, is extra hassle but, to be fair, comes with extra control, responsibility and true ownership.  

It sounds like the OP is speculating that Gamestop might release an NFT marketplace/exchange app with a built-in custodial wallet based on ETH and using LRC to reduce gas fees.  Sounds good to me. However, if I bought an NFT on GME I would still want the ability to get it to a non-custodial wallet - and providing GME included that - I'd buckle up.",1635683782,hirae6o

"Layer-1 is the term that’s used to describe the underlying main blockchain architecture. Layer-2, on the other hand, is an overlaying network that lies on top of the underlying blockchain. 

So when you bought your LRC with binance it’s is on Layer 1. To convert it to layer 2 you would have to tx it to layer 2. 

For example if you check out loopring. If you go to loopring.io you can transfer your crypto to layer 2 but it uses gas to move the crypto to that protocol. The benefits to layer 2 is that once it is layer 2 it doesn’t mess with the underlying blockchain protocol and makes exchanging within layer 2 much cheaper. But converting between L1 and L2 is semi expensive right now. 

The marketplace is going to be built with layer 2 and zkrollups which use substantially less gas for transactions and is much faster than L1. So if you took your binance LRC and moved it to L2 you’d have to pay a gas fee, just like if you moved LRC from L2 to L1.",1635638320,hipf7rq

"It’s great that GME is creating their own NFT market places and such - and I absolutely think that it’s the right thing to do and I wouldn’t ever attempt to discourage that.

But acting like this is all it will take to bring mainstream adoption of DeFi and NFTs is crazy. For the end-user, Ethereum is still super complicated. 

I support Ethereum 100% and you always have to start somewhere, but almost 0 of the transactions that occur on this marketplace are going to come from someone that isn’t already tech-savvy. 

Until you can just create 1 wallet that is able to interact with all of the different DeFi apps seamlessly, it ain’t happening. The fact that there are Layer 1 and Layer 2 wallets is confusing enough for most people. 

Furthermore, this counterfactual wallet Loopring have created is nothing more than a free trial. It’s not free forever. You eventually have to pay the gas-fee to set the wallet up permanently. 

I’m not trying to bash GME or Loopring, as I own GME and some LRC tokens, but what they’re trying to do is NOT easy, and it’s not something that is going to be ready for mainstream adoption straight away. Maybe in a few years - and that’s fine.

I already had a MetaMask wallet because I was going to buy an NFT art piece a few weeks ago. Instead, I used some of my ETH to tip the kengriffinlied.com folks. Either way, I already had some ETH over there. So I transfered in my coins, about .1, to my Loopring wallet. At that point, I was super confused about how to exchange that for LRC. After a bit of poking around, I realized that I need another wallet for LRC.

Unfortunately, I had to pay a bunch of gas getting my ETH over to my Loopring wallet, so I didnt have enough to cover the L2 wallet creation. I couldn't figure out how to get USD into my Loopring wallet so I could buy more ETH (I don't think you can, btw), so I went back to MM and picked up more ETH, then transfered that to my Loopring wallet (paying MORE in gas fees), just to have enough to pay for gas to create my L2 wallet.

Once I did that, I told it to move all into LRC in my L2 wallet. However, it left about 40% of my USD equivalent in ETH in my L1 wallet, and picked me up about 490 LRC. 

All in all, I think I spent about $250 in gas to transfer twice and create my L2 wallet, for a grand total of around $450 worth of ETH and LRC...

Jeez. Not only was that stupid difficult, where a few of those steps could have been streamlined, but it was also stupid expensive. I can absolutely see why they want the new system in place before they launch anything that's supposed to use this tech. I'm in a highly technical sector of IT, and the process was crazy.

Still considering the wallet to stalk alone tho.",1635623332,hioj5g7
Not sure. I’ve never actually used it. As long as you have LRC in another wallet you can easily transfer it. Also I know you can use Loopring to convert other crypto to LRC,1635623021,hioifkv
Low key surprised LRC hasn’t fucking exploded even more than it has in the last 7-10 days,1636829513,hkhjjmd
"Is this code from GitHub?

AMM stands for automated market maker. It's how uniswap works. It's basically a decentralized exchange, and instead of there being an order book, there's pairs of coins that you can trade. Ex: there's two baskets of coins for let's say LRC and USDT, and you can ""deposit"" (sell) LRC in exchange for taking out usdt (sell LRC for usdt). AMMs use a bonding curve for the price.

Essentially LRC will have marketplace selling/buying capability. Note that you can also add liquidity to x/y pair by depositing either x or y in that pair LP basket and you get a cut of the fees from each trade in return. There's risk of impermanent loss doing this. Anyway, I've gone too far now haha",1636828667,hkhhlo7
Lrc x gme &lt;3,1636828549,hkhhbsu
LRC is sick,1636828535,hkhhaif
"I have a feeling LRC/GME will have THE solution you are looking for before January, friend 😉",1636828405,hkhgz6n
Loopring not lrc. Lrc has nothing to do with gme.,1636828268,hkhgnun
Yeah this drives me crazy. LRC is the lower stage of the rocket folks…. HELLO PPL!!!  🚀🚀🚀🚀,1636827708,hkhfdoq
If I transfer my coins out of my wallet that always crashes during market highs to LRC will it handle market chaos? I wonder if I eventually cash out will I pay less in gas fees as well….,1636827410,hkheoh3
"I mean it’s pretty much all but confirmed w/ the coding, wallets, Loopring set to announce a partnership with a “major” company/partner by eoy, GME job postings for NFT positions, etc. 

Plus, wouldn’t Loopring deny the claims of GME? Obviously they know all the hype is because of the rumors, LRC could potentially be demolished with bad sentiment if GME isn’t the partner",1636827300,hkhefdn
"Right, but Loopring uses/supports multiple coins, and runs on top of etherium blockchain, which obviously uses ether.  Even once etherium moves to proof of stake, that doesn't require LRC, it can/will be other coins won't it?",1636827250,hkhebag
Looking more and more like a blockchain stock market with GME/LRC spearheading. Love it.,1636827070,hkhdw18
"Disclaimer : this might be a ongoing pump by HFs as a trap/distraction to Apes, and I do not advise to move any of your GME funds to LRC. 

That being said, my Loopring bag did a x9 since we started talking about it on Superstonk, and it's completing a falling wedge (bullish signal) as we speak : https://ibb.co/k8vF3nR",1636826891,hkhdh8u
"I don’t know about BTC, but LRC is in the Etherium “network”, so, I don’t think you have to sell it, you’re converting it (like exchanging dollars for euros). 

But to be honest, I don’t really know. Don’t make financial decisions based on my insufficient understanding of this.",1636826718,hkhd2aa
Thank you for saying this. I didn't know lrc had any competition with all the hype going on,1636826565,hkhcos8
And LRC,1636826272,hkhc098
"You're still trying to debate something that OP wasn't saying.  No problem talking about LR, LRC, L2 rollowup, etc.

They just said gain porn is a bad idea, which it is.  No one here has much ability to ""steer"" anything.  Just point out that one particular, narrow thing, isn't a great idea.

On an unrelated note, I think you're confused about my supposed LR/LRC confusion.  LRC is very much related to loopring, since it's their coin.  But L2 rollup is not to my knowledge, ""inextricably tied"" to LRC.  LRC can use L2 rollup, but so can NFT's, which don't have to be tied to LRC?

I'll be the first to admit I'm not a loopring expert, but have a very good grasp of tech.  So if I'm wrong, and you can explain how, I can get it.",1636825655,hkhajz0
"LRC gain porn is a total straw man. We’re talking about apes here. They’re doing some combo of two things with LRC gains: hodling it &amp; buying GME. 

You’re still framing this group dynamic in terms of personal influence. To say that one can point out good ideas is still to first-person, not a good way to describe our individual role in a group dynamic, it’s more correct to say that popular ideas will gain visibility. One cannot make outsized corrections to trends that they don’t like. Rebuttal and debate is obviously healthy, but steering is misguided. 

Not looking to do a gotcha but you’re uninformed on the Loopring LRC relationship. They are inextricably linked, to the point of functionally being one. It’s ok not to engage this aspect of GameStop’s development, but misinformation is undeniably unhelpful.",1636825147,hkh9csp
"I wanted to convert some mined ETH into LRC, but gas was $300!",1636824765,hkh8fd7
"I don't know.  Maybe, he is having a moment of honesty and realizes what is coming.  He has to know about loopring and that it is built on etherium, but will basically replace the base platform and become better known and probably a lot more valuable than either ethereum or bit (after it greatly depreciates.  I can only dream that my little lrc coins would ever get to current bit prices.).",1636824685,hkh88ky
"We have no ability to change other's actions, but we can point out actions that would lead to the best result for everyone, and hope a lot of people come along for that ride.

We seem to be debating different things.  LRC is not the same thing as L2 rollup facilitated by loopring.  They're probably related, but they're not the same thing.  And no one has expressed a problem with talking about loopring L2 or LRC.  The only issue is with gain porn, which is a bad idea no matter what it's for.",1636824327,hkh7e5r

"While I do not suggest buying anything in particular, I can say that I am buying LRC by the boatload.",1636822180,hkh2bj3
"That’s like, at least HALF of the reason I have LRC.",1636822147,hkh28kt
"So.  If you're a crypto person like me, and think the stock market is a giant scam, and just comes on here for the meta, then what you are basically saying is buy more LRC?

Got it.",1636821835,hkh1j30
"Oh I was thinking the other way around. Like maaaaaayyyybe the lrc partnership would help gme, but the partnership will DEF help LRC.",1636821539,hkh0up1
"Man i love gme community not trying to put anyone down !! I think many jumped on board of loopring due to code leak . But many have yet to understand tech behind itself as well . There is this two groups now within lrc community one for gme -lrc partnership hopiums !! Another lrc won’t go anywhere without gme . 

 Simple terms lrc won’t help gme with squeeze or anything .  If that partnership comes through it will help gme to open doors to new future .

"I had several different coins that I earned through coinbase learn and earn or whatever they call it that I traded for LRC. I feel the same about my other coins; if I invested in them, it’s because I believe in the tech/projects/etc., so I don’t want to jump ship on them.",1636821134,hkgzx54
"I mean can you convert Bitcoin to, say, LRC, without first selling the Bitcoin to purchase LRC?",1636819235,hkgvkbx
"I think they're working on something similar to what the DTCC was hinting at in their statement they released. GME + LRC are going to beat them to it though.

I think it's not going to be limited at all though. I think it's going to be used for merchandise and games as well as securities. I think part of the reason it might be taking so long is working with other entities. There are probably NDAs we don't know about. I think this is going to be way bigger than any of us realize. I sincerely believe this will revolutionize our financial system. It's going to at more utility to crypto than anything before it.",1636819127,hkgvbid
"What would we say is a fair price for loopring?  Just got 20k inheritance, RIP grandfather,  lived a hell of a life.  Want to buy more GME but am considering putting some in LRC.  been watching it since 0.30 with no cash to dump into it. Now I do. Are we at the top at 3.00 or is this game just getting started?",1636819031,hkgv3rc
"What's cool is you get to chose which crypto you want to use for fees. You can use LRC, ETH, USDT, and a few others. Just thought that was a neat feature.",1636815600,hkgnske
"Loopring is the company that created the zkrollup protocol.  Their coin, LRC (which is actually an ERC-20 token), is required to make transactions on their L2 blockchain.",1636815375,hkgncma
"You're right that we shouldn't tell people what to do with their money, but he's also right about it delaying the gme squeeze.  It is super plausible for shf to pump/dump LRC, they've already done it on half the other crip toes.  And money not being spent on gme helps delay the day that shf are under unmanageable pressure.",1636814534,hkglph0
"I watch the sub via rss feeds, so I see a pretty different subset of the posts than a lot of people.  I don't know how much is out there, but the correct amount would be zero.

I'm not a denialist, as it's possible there'll be a gme/lrc connection.  But it's not certain.  Either way, I'm fine with talking about the links, just don't post gain porn of anything other than gme, in a gme sub.  And really, even gme gain porn is sus, especially during moass.  We need less encouragement to sell early, not more.",1636814294,hkgl8wl

I am no expert but have done a bit of reading. Basically a dao allows you to store your coins in a liquidity pool and they pay you interest. I have seen some which pay ridiculous rates like 8k% annual.

ETH will undoubtedly have a strong run like BTC. But the value of LRC lays in its low market cap, which as you can see LRC can easily double overnight. ETH PROBABLY won’t do this, but ETH will have more utility and is most likely a much safer long term play.

Obviously not financial advice, and open to debate.",1636763194,hkeeo8g
"I mean, he is probably multi-millionaire already because of the LRC pump (augmented by the GME announcement hype).",1636763030,hkeebyh
"Um no. I’m not spending 100% of my paychecks and savings on GME only. People should not be putting every last dollar into GME.

I have a good enough life that I can wait this out, and although GME is going to be amazing. I am not throwing all my eggs into one basket.

And trust me that I have a lot of shares in GME already.

What I get from LRC, is another ticket to stare at all day. Probably minimal manipulation by citadel, and enough upside while I wait for MOASS. I literally can pull out 20k and dump it into GME from the gains so far. And even if I don’t pull it out, I expect LRC to go higher as well. But I’m not trying to shill for it so feel free to do your own research :)",1636762873,hkee03w
"As stated by another ape in one of your convos, ""it depends on the contract with GameStop. It may not be the primary nor exclusive too. Loopring is likely being paid for a service, which would be on their terms, and that doesn't have to include LRC"".",1636762593,hkedeue

"Willing to write up some DD on it? Tired of seeing LRC is not relevant to GME. I agree it shouldn't be pushed to buy LRC as this is a GME sub. But if we start picking and choosing what evidence and connections to bring up we're no different from MSM.

"Do you know about the connection between gme and lrc? 

Know much about crypto? 

Here’s the rub, lrc pumped hard on the rumored connection with GME. Went from like .40 to 3.92 at peak on that pump. The rise in price triggered lots of investment from that community. 

Not sure about you but I caught that wave and made a bunch of money that I promptly put into gme

Chucked another 150 in on Friday, and so far I'm up to $1700, trading swings. I'm trying to keep hold of some futures contracts for when it moons, otherwise I'm just buying dips and selling peaks.",1636335389,hjr26cc
"You’ll get there. I converted my brother to the cause back in June (he was big on blue chip stocks and intro level crypto...now he’s XXX deep in GME). Personally, I don’t think it’s a bad move having a crypto side piece - it’ll all be dumped into GME regardless. It all hinges upon an official announcement. 

I used coinbase. LRC is there. Shouldn’t take long to set up. They give the option to buy instantly w/ debit card up to...$7,500 I think? You’ll have to look the limit up. Obviously, you can also pay through bank transfer too, with $25K limit I think. Slower process though - shouldn’t be an issue really because I expect LRC between $1.30-1.60 for the time being (until a GME announcement).  

Regardless of your decision, take note of the potential volatility, be patient, and if/when it moons significantly, throw that shit right back into GME pronto!",1636334180,hjqzlkg
"I did the same thing. For the record, I’m an XXXX holder of GME, and I haven’t bought anything (stocks or crypto) since May, and the vast majority of what I have was purchased back in February and March. Ironically enough, half of the funds I used to get GME back when it was $45 or so, were from what I made hodling 1 BTC from 2018 to 2021 (going from $7K to $52K) - from crypto to stocks, in essence. 

So, I’m amenable to this sort of thing myself. Truth be told, I had the same intuition you did with LRC. I heard the GME rumors, and I figured it would pump significantly before GME would. So far, just off of rumor-driven hype, that’s certainly been true. The question is whether a real announcement would garner bigger gains for LRC, or for GME. Obviously, both will gain in the short term, but I’d be willing bet (as you likely are) that LRC could jump to anywhere between the $3-7 range, while GME (short of announcing an actual crypto dividend) would potentially just be tamped down by SHFs before beaching the $350 mark. 

For the record, I stupidly bought up $1,700 LRC at $1.56. I saw the brief $1.93 peak, knew it was a bit overextended, and didn’t expect it would drop back to close to $1.08 (and this is obviously after having seen it pump from like $0.30 to over a dollar within a week - I kick myself for not having gotten in earlier). 

Personally, I’d say go for it. I expect an official announcement confirming a partnership with GameStop any day or week now through the end of the year. When that happens, you can definitely expect a big rally. How big? Again, potentially $3, $5, $7,...and beyond, who knows? But judging by how much the price has spiked from just rumors ($.30 to $.50 jumps when the github stuff was found), the coin will obviously explode if/when this happens. 

After that point, I plan on dumping it all back into GME in one huge batch.",1636332657,hjqwexp
LRC with a lil Sunday pump. Foreshadowing?,1636331980,hjquys0
"I'd go to a crypto sub and ask them how to buy LRC. This is a gme sub not a crypto one, even if your proceeds will be to purchase more GME.",1636331526,hjqtyva

"I have an old HS buddy who works for RH in their crypto space, something to do with managing liquidity.  I was talking to him how I was getting into crypto (mostly just LRC and ETH) and we discussed some of his stuff.

He was surprised that I knew the difference between CEX and DEX and I was questioning what kind of liquidity RH could maintain on certain coins should DEX become popular, hypothetically.  Like if tomorrow someone announced you could setup a DEX without fees and start trading, there would be no need to keep your coins on A CEX like RH, and as coins left the exchange due to true ownership elsewhere, they’d get squeezed out due to lack of liquidity.  He said he had never thought of that, and it was a good point and hopefully it didn’t happen soon.

"when the gme share is at a rate of exchange (7 nft 4 1 gme share, for example) to nft/eth crypto anytime the nft/depository share/fractional goes up in value the share value increases 7x

so:

if the depository share/nft fractional goes up $1 the the gme share goes up $7

if the depository share/nft fractional goes up $20 the gme share goes up $140

that's cool enough on it's own but then there's also lrc and also eth.

if lrc goes up, which the gme nft fractional will be tied to because of the marketplace, then it stands to reason the gme fractional will also goes up.

if all this action with gme fractional, gme share and lrc is happening I guess a bunch of market will dump xbt and pump lrc.

that's not the end of yet, loopring is doing fiat L2 ramps. what that means is currently, in order to get in eth you have to open a wallet, join a cex, buy crypto, wait for settlement then move to lrc and pay gas. too 'long' for mainstream

fiat to L2 ramps means you can open an account, connect your atm cash account, and buy lrc, done. push that lrc to L2, no gas because it's an L2 ramp, and then buy in the gamestop w3/lrc exchange.

"Now GME has $1.5B in cash, is debt free, and has grown it's online presence to be highly competitive with Amazon and other digital retailers. It has 2 day deliveries in some locations. They have almost half a billion in inventory, and are heavily investing in delivery infrastructure. They sell much more than video games, and are now sell PC parts, televisions, collectables, and they still kill it on their console revenue. They are also working on an online marketplace to buy and trade gaming-related NFTs, which some think will compete with FaceBook's metaverse. This company is not going anywhere and is growing rapidly.

You may be asking yourself ""how in the ever-loving fuck does a company have every single one of it's shares shorted twice""? Well, it turns out that one of the above mentioned parties, Citadel Securities, is what is called a MArket MAker. Essentially, brokers send their orderflow to Citadel, and Citadel makes the buy or sell for the broker. At least that's how it should work. It turns out, that Citadel likely shorted the vast majority of buy orders that get routed through it (at least for GME). And instead of giving you a share when you buy it, they give you an IOU. Meanwhile, they sell the share they should have bought for you, and tell regulators that they can cover their position with cheap options contracts. THIS IS ILLEGAL. They are essentially taking your money and giving you an IOU instead of a share, knowing full well that their buddies who they can borrow a share from won't charge them much interest. This is counterfeiting of shares, plain and simple.

So, when the banks and hedgefunds that are owed actual GME shares call the short hedge funds for their shit back (called a margin call), everyone knows that the vast majority of shares are counterfeit. All of the IOUs have to be cancelled out, and then the entire float must be returned to it's rightful owners. This means anyone who owns GME stock (which you can verify is 100% real by direct registering shares with GME's bookkeeper, ComputerShare), or anyone with an IOU, gets to literally name their price for their shares.

It turns out naked short selling (selling without having the share to give back, or equivalently counterfeiting a share) is a practice that hedge funds and market makers use to essentially steal the money from a company's market cap. This type of thing is impossible with crypt0, because every coin or NFT contract is validated by miners. With American stocks, the vast majority of all stocks are owned by 1 single corporation with an internal ledger, the Depository Trust Company (DTC or DTCC), which turns a blind eye and itself profits from selling counterfeit shares.

So GME has been shorted more times than there are shares. The majority of shares on the market are IOUs. Every IOU must be bought in order to cancel it out, and then all real shares must be returned to their owners. This means that when the market crashes, like if Evergrand defaults and cannot be contained, then when people call asking for their shit back during the market collapse, anyone who owns GME will be able to name their price in order to sell it to a hedgefund which tried to steal this company's market cap. And this company is not only not dying, it is growing into new sectors, including the crypt0 space.

We don't know when MOASS will happen. It can happen due to margin calls on a market downswing. It could happen because every share in the float gets registered with GME's bookkeeper, exposing that all shares trading on the market are counterfeits. It could happen when GME decides to offer it's shareholders a dividend, potentially as an NFT, thus requiring shorts to cover in order for GME to determine who gets a dividend, and who doesn't. It is anticipated that GME will announce their NFT marketplace in collaboration with LRC, and reward shareholders with unique NFTs, forcing short sellers to cover, causing the MOASS on not only the GME, but also the NFTs that GME distributes.",1639190733,ho2lo40

"1) MOASS is expected because the shorts never closed. A lot of evidence points to this fact, starting with extreme OTM puts (bets that a stock will go down) at less than $5.00, the fact that the SEC report states that retail pressure was what caused the run-up in Jan, and a PLETHORA of other nuanced and direct reasons. I will paste what someone else responded to me earlier to give an idea:

""The things that kept me around despite being skeptical were:

I’m not a big blame MSM guy, but seeing the headlines that GameStop is over and Reddit is now shorting silver was eye opening. That and the paid advertising to say that Melvin covered.

Degiro had GameStop as the most traded stock of the month for nearly every month of the year in most countries. GME is truly a worldwide phenomenon.

Seeing the huge put purchase on March 10th that dropped the share price straight off a cliff. Someone clearly benefits from keeping the price low. Shorts can’t have covered.

The voting in April had the highest % of votes I’ve ever seen. Then there was the shareholder meeting. In the middle of COVID, retailers filled the room just from people that lived in the area.

During the Brazilian puts day, some ape found the mail box that the hedge fund was registered to. The kicker was he wasn’t the only person there. It’s a testament to how many people own GameStop.

How quickly Superstonk hit 200K subscribers. Superstonk went from the low thousands to 200K in a few hours. I’ve never seen anything like that.

The day that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond announced accelerating their share buyback the stock went up 80%. GME and the rest of the basket of shorts instantly soared.""





2) It is always a good price to buy in. The company itself is doing amazing things (we've come to these conclusions by reading the writing on the wall), and the MOASS is 100% expected.

3) When Evergrande defaults, it will ruin the collateral used by short hedgefunds (SHF) in order to maintain their extreme position in GME, which is under extreme pressure due to buying. They must keep pushing their position deeper to keep the price from going up, which is catastrophic for their bottom line. There are many ways they've been working to hide all of this. Read the DD, seriously.

Or is it because there’s alternatives out there to LRC which are more established and robust than it? If the news does come out that GME is working with LRC for their own marketplace, would you expect the price of LRC to sky rocket alongside the price of GME?",1639185931,ho2b45z

"I agree with your points, truly.  I like the stock and where it’s believed to be going, I’m just saying, I’m tired of the sub having to decrypt cryptic Twitter, or doing all this on their own.  

We don’t even know LRC is teaming with GME.  I mean, it’s pretty much a 99% certain, I’ll give you that, but there’s no verification either, and that’s what I’m talking about.  You don’t necessarily need to address the naked shorts, or direction of the company, but the lack of dialogue of any magnitude is not ideal in my opinion.  

From what I remember, RCs gag order was actually early December, so he’s freely able to discuss things.  Regardless, Matt finestone is CEO, he can speak as needed.

I think RC is doing a magnificent job, but personally, I’m not a fan of the cryptic tweets, once monthly, as a basis for my DD.  I’d rather more communication, but I’m not going to sell because of it.  I’m only expressing my opinion, especially on a post related to communication that doesn’t actually exist.

On a side note, I hopped onboard the DEX last night. Holy shit. It is flawless. I threw some ETH on (the fees to get crypto onto L2 are still steep, I paid $94 to move 250 - BUT sleep in mind these are flat fees, so don’t move $10 at a time, save up and make one big transfer and wait until fees are low as they fluctuate based on network congestion, but $94 is a decent price in the current state). Once on the DEX. Holy cow. Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. It cost me 0.01 to exchange my ETH to LRC. This is unheard of and ground breaking.

How I understand it, everyone's wallets will be constantly updated with these purchases but only behind the scenes at loopring. There is no way to duplicate a defi coin that I know of and that's the point.

The picture was edited specifically to have that same exact shade of blue, Theres no damn way the camera just happened to pick up that exact shade of blue it lights up.

I totally agree and I think we’re kind of saying the same thing. I realized a couple days ago that the LRC announcement I’d been dying for and overly pumped to hear about just isn’t the one. GameStop makes the big one themselves. They didn’t commit to a timeframe like LRC did either.

You won’t need to know how to code there will be a user interface. You will upload whatever it is that you want to mint as an nft.

I personally feel there is going to be much more to it and RC will drop a bomb when he’s ready and it’ll be something msm can’t ignore. An open marketplace for creators to sell their content is great, but we haven’t been waiting a year plus for for a cheaper version of Opensea. No way. There’s going to be much more to it.

First off, we already all know about the partnership. This would just be a confirmation. I think the real announcement is going to be RC dropping a bomb about the new marketplace, not LRC. While an open marketplace for all creators to sell their work is awesome, I believe there’s going to be something much more to it that is going to knock our socks off. I feel GS has held their cards way to tight for us to be able to put a hype date on it. We only figured out the partnership because they wanted us to.

"Google ""NFT use cases"" and you'll find a mountain of examples across a plethora of fields. Such sources can explain it better than I can, and have. The distinguishing factors for GMA/LRC (over Opensea, for example) are the Layer 2 protocol, counterfactual wallets and fiat on/off ramps (buy near-directly with cash instead of requiring an intermediary crypto purchase).

But the underlaying ”coin” will be lrc that runs the platform. On the top, could be gme’s own currency, that is then integrated towards the underlaying lrc coin, that would fit in with keeping their nft platform attached to real life values. For example, for gme ”power up subscriptions” could use this coin in the future to but physical things in the stores, as the above layer coin. Aswell as buying virtual nfts, spend the currency at coming nft ”play to earn” games… and more! 

Loads of posibilities.

I’m not the “why would someone pay for a digital art form,” because I am a bit of an art collector and understand that just art itself has value. My first thought about NFTs were that they were basically digital certificates of authenticity. I’m starting to understand how they can be used where an owner in a chain of ownership can still retain some profits/rights, and I get the “gas” (fees) is not cheap right now, which is one thing LRC is working to make cheaper and more accessible.

One thing (of many) I don’t understand when reading about this platform is, why is there a porting of the price just “burned up?”",1640719407,hqbajc4
"Yeah so that was my hesitation for a long time with NFTs and crypto in general. For a while, it seemed like the only value was hype (which, for what it's worth, isn't worthless); but to me, it looked like a solution to a problem that didn't exist. I figured there'd be something out there that crypto/NFTs would be good at, and for once I think we have it: Smart Contracts. Don't think of NFTs, LoopRing, or Crypto as speculative currencies or collectibles. Instead, know that Ethereum is a network with a defined protocol (that is, a way of doing stuff) and that LoopRing is a protocol that takes advantage of some tricks of computer science and math to make Smart Contracts cheaper (that is, use fewer resources) than ever before. What is a Smart Contract? It's exactly that-- an agreement between two parties to do/exchange a service, good, or execute an agreement. That's all. This is why people are like ""they sky's the limit"". It's not that NFTs are valuable, it's that the types of secure, open, cheap, and fast contracts that can be written/executed on these networks will provide a framework for some cool stuff (I would hazard to compare this to early internet stuff, bubble and all). We don't entirely know what can be done with NFTs in the GameStop marketplace built on a secure LoopRing protocol in an Etherium network, but we know that if it's cheap/free, open, accessible, and secure, it will be kick ass. Like how Napster led to Pandora, which got edged out by Spotify. None of that was possible without http and later https, css, PTP protocols, and other types of now ubiquitous secure-ish protocols. So for once the hype might be justified. You spend some money wagering that GameStop is going to be the early leader in this space, and maybe toss in a few coins to hold LRC on the side in case it blows up (as Smart Contracts get adopted and the chips grown in value). That's it. At this point in the saga, there's not much more to talk about. Shorts likely gave their positions to MMs who internalized the risk and are trying to unwind it. Probably not gonna go well for them which gives you built-in upside. On top of that, the company itself is legitimately doing some innovative stuff a la before the internet and the dot com boom. Just hang out, manage your position (average down when you can, buy more when you want), and know that you bought front row seats to the likely next big thing. Also memes.",1640718427,hqb826e

"1) If you're referring to the NFT dividend that Overstock did a few years back and that courts said was perfectly legal earlier this year, then yes. That would be a fraud-proof dividend that SHFs couldn't copy. My only reply to this is that we do not have proof of such a thing until it happens. I think it likely will (and am hoping for it to be soon), but I wanted to encourage people to not get ahead of what we know and not get ahead of ourselves.

2) I will cry tears of joy if one of the partners that LRC has announces a blockchain stock market ... when it happens. I also want to leave the door open to someone other than GME making that blockchain stock market. Plenty of companies have faced the pain of synthetic shares, and several companies could be working with LRC on their new layer two technology. GME doesn't have to do it all. We don't *know* until everything is announced.

Again. I'm just trying to be realistic and set expectations about what we know as of right now. I thought this shit would pop at the shareholder meeting in June. I've been in since Jan. Tempered expectations allow us to stick to the ComputerShare plan that RC has left breadcrumbs to all year.

This guy has built Loopring for \~10 year (or some number of years). It's fucking sharp. It's ready to kill. It's never been tested.

This feels like: okay, Loopring built this amazing tool, and they found the ""king"" aka Ryan Cohen and GameStop. And he's ready to fight the noble battle. The sword is only as good as the use it's put to.  
  
Remember Cohen's tweet with the sumo wrestlers? They are doing battle against the tech titans. This is about Power to the Players. This is about deploying the NFT exchange, and it is coming soon!

loopringbot shows you via tweet withdrawls from and deposits into LRC, you can get a 'feel' for people going into lrc or coming out

the thing I'd really like to get across to apes here is that while superstonk is a stock market subreddit the gamestop play has never been just about the stock market.

if you want to know where this whole thing is going next: read up on layer-2 crypto and Decentralized Finance.

"Not necessarily anti-LRC, just anti LRC on this sub. No reason it shouldn't be banned along w/ all the other crypto until anything official is announced. Why special treatment for that one?",1635818362,hiyn70h
There is a heavy anti-LRC movement brother. God forbid we make a profit and spend it on GME DRSd shares.,1635818267,hiymzjo
"Well, to quote his comment, ""If LRC fails so does GameStop.""",1635818181,hiymsti
"Just dm’d you what they posted here. They posted it on the other gme sub and it was subsequently removed as well. Though it only had like 100ish upvotes there compared to the 2000 here. I can’t see their superstonk post now though.. now it’s only on the lrc sub. WHERE IT BELONGS. I hate how we can’t link to other subs though, is just link it here. Sorry to DM ya.",1635817877,hiym4gg
Having them post positions is the dumbest thing I’ve heard when we keep saying to not post positions. However if we ban anything with LRC we should also ban any other company or news regarding GME. Nothing has changed since the Game Over NFT came out identifying with loopring. Full disclosure yes I do own LRC from converting my coins I get for free from Coinbase earn. Also full disclosure I haven’t sold shit since I aped in the Wednesday before robinhood fucked us. I’m still hodling GME and don’t plan on selling.,1635817662,hiylmy2
"Which is a more accurate statement to make…?

GME is confirmed to have &gt;100% it float short at this moment. 

LRC and GME are confirmed to be intrinsically tied and related to one another.",1635817484,hiyl8l9
"I had to tag all mods to a post last night. It was removed, but only after 2000 upvotes and a migration to the LRC sub as this dude shilled that coin here. Here’s some Imgur shots https://imgur.com/a/f96XsSB and I’ll link to that post",1635817422,hiyl3oj
"I think it seems legit. If they are truly behind GME NFT, then it’s a natural play. If we find out someone else is helping GME NFT then LRC is DOA.",1635817406,hiyl2fj
"Gamestop does not need NFT for MOASS.

NFT is a shortcut to the MOASS, DRSing the float/outstanding share is the backup long term plan. 

MOASS will provide Gamestop with rich loyal customers to continue and prosper.

If LRC fails, all it does is make Gamestop find another provider or make their own NFT market place. Ya it'll take a longer time, but it's not reliant on it.",1635817291,hiykt8w
You think the whole LRC is just a distraction? It’s even got the smooth brain thinking,1635817174,hiykjj4

"I HaVe LrC MySeLf... nobody asked.  


Edit/ Sorry that was rude. But for real haha",1635817033,hiyk8g1
You're talking about LRC more than anyone else on this sub dude,1635816948,hiyk1qd
"I agree with most everything you said. 

But it glosses over the fact that the L2 Etherum tech Loopring has (zkrollups, no gas NFTs) is the technology that GameStop is going to be using. LRC coins are what provide the liquidity for that to function. I’m sure GME could figure out a way to run a marketplace that doesn’t depend on LRC coins underpinning the functionality - but from what I can tell, they hired a team because they specifically chose to make a marketplace that does. 

It’s cool though. No one in that other sub wanted to listen to DFV talk about GameStop for the first year or so, either. There will be people who want to hear it and then there will be group think that doesn’t care about anything but DRS and bussy cakes. 

I don’t have any argument with OP (or any other ape) and I think that everything said here is in good faith. No one is shilling, we just generally have a slightly different view on what is related to the stock. I’m ok that I have a minority view at the moment. Ape no fight ape.",1635816799,hiyjprs
I agree with you OP. I own LRC and that thesis is totally separate from GME. Neither depend on the other 🤷‍♂️,1635816756,hiyjmdh
"Not LoopRing the company, LRC the *coin*.

Discuss the company 'til the cows come home, but the coin has its own sub for that.",1635816717,hiyjjb8
"Fuck off dude. There’s a mod post made 3 hours ago distinctly saying to not discuss LRC and crypto.

I’m happy for you. I really am. But stop pushing your personal referral codes.",1635816709,hiyjip2
"The last picture on my link shows that their counterfactual wallet will allow direct purchasing into the L2 to avoid fees. 

This is the sad fact of etherium right now if you actually want to use it which is why LRC will be king in the not too distant future.",1635816702,hiyji4n
Execution always is the part of everything that is unknown unfortunately. No one is guaranteed success - and hopefully GME/LRC Barry Bonds this bitch to Mars,1635816542,hiyj5es
"I think people are just hyping it cause there is a potential link to GME. I agree that this is a GME sub and should stay strictly GME, but it isn't like anyone pushed DWAC or Shiba here. Most likely anyone posting about LRC is being genuine.",1635816519,hiyj3md
"If looping fails (which I have no reason to believe it would)GameStop just buys the patent and runs zk roll ups on their own, Finestone is capable and then the LRC coin is dead like squid coin and GME is flying high. Blue pill MOASS, red pill also MOASS",1635816500,hiyj250
"Nice article, concise and on point. GME + LRC news = tots jacked",1635816479,hiyj0dk
"
&gt;If you are calling LoopRing a pump and dump

Which I'm sure not. I'm calling this LRC run up a pump&amp;dump, that is supposed to distract us.",1635816423,hiyivxf
"There's the disconnect. LoopRing is a company, not LRC.

Company ≠ Coin

It's easy to *not* talk about a crypt0currency when the COMPANY is the only thing tying it to GME. GameStop is using LoopRing's technology to build their platform, but that doesn't hinge on the coin going up.

The coin is a cashgrab for day traders as far as I see it, and we've never been about that here.

Same with popcorn, it popped because it was heavily shorted *along with GameStop*.",1635816200,hiyielr
"LRC and GME are all powered by Etherium, I would think if anything ETH would be the play. I can’t find out what role LRC even has. I thought GME had their own crypto and it was either that or ETH if crypto was involved. I’m sticking to GME, cus this is all that there is until GME themselves says otherwise.",1635816045,hiyi2d5
"Again, I don’t think it just popped up. We’ve had 6 months of DD talking about why we all think LRC is partnered with GME. Within a week of the source code leaking that basically confirms it - it’s like we aren’t supposed to talk about it all
of a sudden. 

And I appreciate that people are trying to say “talk about loopring but not LRC”. It’s kind hard when LRC is up 100% in a day. That’s like saying “talk about GME without talking about purple circles”. It’s just all part of the same conversation. Lrc wouldn’t be popping if it weren’t for the GME news. There’s waaaaaaay more evidence to support LRC is related to GME than there is to the wu tang theory or whatever 741 theory of the day someone has.",1635816010,hiyhzld
"LoopRing is a company. LRC is a coin.

Company ≠ Coin",1635815890,hiyhpx3
This sub is “a theoretical place to talk about business and stocks - specifically GameStop (GME).” That’s on the banner. Tell me why that means the only thing we can talk about is locking up the float? Why can’t we talk about how LRC and GME benefit each other? That is 100% appropriate.,1635815498,hiygux1
"Maybe in your eyes. I turned $500 into 1k since last Wednesday on LRC. That’s buying me 5 more GME. Maybe it’s not for you, but it is for other people.",1635815480,hiygtfg
"This — keep in mind — uses DeFi technology, while LRC is merely a coin. This comment is just for apes scrolling by, not you u/thinkmoreharder, great explanation!",1635815376,hiygl99
"Honestly posts like this are what give us hardcore GME backers a bad name. You DO understand that by getting the crypto family onboard (that 2.5 TRILLION market cap thing) that has gone up as much if not more than GME, with millions of retail investors like us buying their own choice of pain.

If we get 20% of them to think you know what, this GME is legit (with its crypto move) and dump in, it could literally cause the MOAS by itself. They have a lot of retail cash/power. 10x more than us at this stage.

I doubled my bag on LRC/Loopring in 3 days and flipped the profits right into more GME shares. 

You need to grow up friend.",1635815323,hiygh2c
"I literally just said I sold existing btc to buy gme’s partner. Not sell gme for lrc. I still DCA DRS shares monthly. And buy gmes In my roth when I can with CC premies. 

Either way. We’re all 🦍🦍 just 💎🙌🏼. Mine is just an extra hedge to the hedgies. 

Good luck! 🦍🦍",1635815239,hiygace
I am getting very tired of hearing about LRC.,1635815090,hiyfyho
"I’ve been on this sub since it was created, And other subs before they were blown up. Even have an shirt from the Diane Fossey Foundation. So you’re not even close. 
However, I’m sick of people trying to police this sub in the comments because they think LRC isn’t GME. Sure, GameStop hasn’t confirmed it nor has Loopring, but just as it hasn’t been proven, it hasn’t been disproven. Literally just as much as it’s not GME related, it’s just as much related.",1635815054,hiyfvna
"LRC is a coin, not a company. LoopRing has a connection with GameStop (that still isn't even official), not the coin.

Buying LRC does ziltch for GameStop.",1635814899,hiyfj6m
Tell me how buying LRC is gonna help the float get locked up,1635814865,hiyfghn
So lrc crypto is not loopring?,1635814771,hiyf8zx
"personally read about loopring here...breadcrumbs can lead to something.

I think you are cheating potential gains from people by frowning upon well founded speculation that GME may be intertwined with LoopRing, and hence, LRC.

If LoopRing and GME infact do announce a partnership like many speculate, both (GME &amp; LRC) are going to see massive upswings in share / coin price.  LRC is a relatively low cost crypto currently.

Far from a sure thing, but don't cheat people out of potential gains by suppressing mentions of Loopring and their corresponding crypto offering.

My worthless .02 $LRC at this point",1635814409,hiyeg7z
"They could easily launch on Harmony One just as an example, which is in a lot of ways already L2. Davinci Gallery is rock solid.

I do believe that they are swinging for the fences with LRC (if it is indeed to be).  LRC talks up a pretty big game about the services they offer.  Vitalik says they're going to present the first decentralized exchange and is very bullish on the project.",1635814400,hiyefjk
"Gamestop is partnered with Loopring to make a NFT marketplace(The leak basically confirms this). Even if Loopring fails(Unlikely considering the ties GameStop has with them), they can always find another partner to help them launch the marketplace. LRC from my understanding is Loopring’s token, and even if it fails it won’t affect Gamestop any more than delaying their plans.",1635814347,hiyebbz
I vote no on LRC ban.  I think it is important to the cause.  Say coconuts to apes.  Not tasty bananas but I’m sure they love some coconut.,1635814223,hiye1c0
Lrc is pretty strong tho.,1635814113,hiydseq
"LRC is *not* DeFi, it's a crypt0currency. You're thinking about DeFi.",1635814083,hiydq3m
"Lotta people don't understand the following:

Loopring ≠ LRC (Loopring Coin)

If LRC goes bust, someone else could come along and utilize the Loopring technology.

GameStop is inevitable.

GameStop can't stop.",1635813951,hiydfu0
"Personally, I do too, but there has been a lot of ""pumping"" of LRC. It's one thing to talk about loopring and how it relates to GME, it's another to post pics of LRC's growth with titles like ""LOOK AT THIS!!!!""",1635813937,hiydeso
"You seem to be on a quest to accuse folks of FUDding.  Clipping and reposting your own text.  Should we call you Reverend?  The Salem Witch Trials mentality that's forming here should be alarming.

That being said, I agree that GME success is separate from the success of LRC.  They have a thousand options for the NFT market but it makes a lot of sense to partner with LRC.  And the NFT market is only a portion of the rebuild (although very important).",1635813718,hiycxdz
And you can do all the other quizzes and convert your prizes to LRC for free on Coinbase,1635813670,hiyctih
"So you can’t read… the screenshot shows if you watch a 1 minute video, you earn FREE LRC. And he said he’d flip that for GME. FFS people on this sub are softer than Charmin.",1635813613,hiycp10
"Gamma squeezes happen because of multiple call options being exercised. In all cases of a squeeze, there is forced buying happening. No one will be forced to buy LRC.",1635813320,hiyc19o
The push for LRC lately feels like FUD to get apes to buy crypto instead of GME,1635813306,hiyc04h
"This post is perfectly clear in what it's saying.

Shilling is when you try to push another stock, a coin, or some kind of distraction from GME.

This post is saying not to shill LRC.

Check my post history if you don't trust me.",1635813300,hiybznb
"Gotcha, yeah I may stick with LRC in Coinbase for now then. $90 Cad to create a wallet isn't a dealbreaker for me, but I'd rather keep that 90 invested elsewhere till something like you described is available",1635949568,hj5gsdw

I don't believe this is a pump and dump.  There are plenty of apes that have also opened positioned in LRC knowing something is brewing.  There is a big difference between crip - toe investors and 'we like the stock' security investors.

"I think it is could be a bunch of lrc token holders selling while the price is high. Not sure if this token has anything to do with the value of loopring. It is supposed to be used for paying for transactions right? So it should have a stable price so the cost is predictable for the users.
Or am I misunderstanding this?",1635894964,hj2rmmr

"Need a crackdown on LRC shilling.. loopring does not equal LRC.  Talking about NFT marketplace potential, NFT dividend, the partnership is cool in my book. 

Telling people about the coin, price speculation, how/where to buy, saying “I hold both”, FUD about if “lrc tanks so does GMEs NFT marketplace”, posting about LRC here and going back to their subs to talk about apes buying in, and many more angles are being used.

Pretty much any profit is just more ammo for GME at this point.",1635876491,hj1g8y9

"This is the part I agree with:

&gt;GME is the play, and DRS is the way. I don't give a shit about LRC because that's not going to trigger or help the MOASS and only serves as a distraction.  
&gt;  
&gt;NOTICE: I'm saying LRC, not LoopRing.  
&gt;  
&gt;I understand that a potential partnership is going on, but buying into their crypt0 before GameStop has even confirmed said partnership is like saying NFTCon would have triggered the MOASS. Feel free to discuss the platform and what the partnership can do, but do not go on about the price of their coin on Superstonk.

I also don't give a fuck about LRC and honestly haven't seen a single post about it so I don't even know why the need for your PSA. But I agree, pumping shit coins is distraction and annoying as hell. There is also an annoying trend of the ""don't let this get silenced"" ""don't let the dvoters win""... rhetoric that equally annoys me. Let your information speak for itself, don't use spam popup ad clickbait tactics, that shit is cheap.

Every post is a PSA, you don't need to announce it. I'm just nitpicking at the annoying trends around here lately and you are just engaging, which I respect. Don't get discouraged tho, I think you are putting in good effort, but changing your tone and avoiding telling people what they need to do will take you a long way.

That's fine if you think I'm lying.",1635875845,hj1em32
"The entire concept of DRS locking up the float to force MOASS is absolutely hilariously absurd.  

If you want the shares in your name (for some reason) go for it.  I, personally, would not pay to do that and instead would put that money back into GME or LRC but that's just me.  But acting like registration is putting pressure on hedges is asinine.",1637676341,hlro9s6

**What is the Loopring token (LRC)**    
The Loopring token (LRC) is the native token of the Loopring protocol and is the core utility + governance token of the Loopring ecosystem.

Currently, the LRC token can be used to pay fees on Loopring L2 and is also used to incentivize behavior that is beneficial for the Loopring ecosystem. Fees paid to the Loopring Exchange are shared + can be earned by liquidity providers, insurers (coming soon!), and DAO members/stakers (coming soon!). 

We also distribute rewards to LRC token holders if they participate in our layer-2 liquidity mining programs.   In the future, the LRC token will become the core of the Loopring DAO, enabling token holders to become governors of the protocol + earn fees generated by the protocol for doing so.",1637670849,hlredbr

"That would be if GameStop minted their own NFT(s) as the dividend. It would have no cash equivalent value unlike LRC, which does. Therefore it would be impossible for a short holder to pay the dividend and thus force their hand in to closing the position.

Ken has said they would do anything to survive another day. Paying $2B+ would simply be the cost of surviving another day",1637670014,hlrd39z

"Now I’m confused, because there was DD months ago speaking on an Overstock-esque dividend issuance would force synthetics shares to be bought back at open market, as well as the crypt coin dividend payout... 

And digressing to the LRC scenario payout, that’s still a $2B+ hit to Shorts paying at $2.75/LRC on 122M+ synthetics at a 7:1 ratio.",1637669508,hlrccch
"Everything it seems. Read the article I linked on LRC tokenomics. Issuing a dividend does not require short positions to close either. They can just pay the dividend out themselves and like I said, they would just pay the cash equivalent to shareholders with the value determined at a single point in time. Most likely record date",1637669221,hlrbxqr
why not sell LRC and buy more GME,1637669081,hlrbqbi
New plan - going to live off my small LRC investment and NEVER SELL ANY OF MY GME SHARES… 🤔,1637668891,hlrbgox
"You say “that is not what LRC is for”... which I honestly don’t understand. LRC is a cr.ypt0currency. I can go on Coinbase and buy/trade LRC for a USD as I would a Doggy or Bit or Eth. What am I missing... 

In regards to your SHFs remark, Short positions come in varying form of both hedge funds and retail a like. I would think that said positions come in varied packaged sizes and thus a buy back during closings would be irregularly timed. I may be misconstruing the fundamentals of issuance, but how can all short positions close at one set price without the underlying crypt being bought back on said market at variable purchases, eg an LRC spike.",1637668715,hlrb7ue
"No. I don't think you get it. If the value of LRC is say $2.75 on the record/payment date then SHF could simply pay the cash equivalent aka $2.75, or in your 7:1 scenario $19.25, to all shareholders. Price of LRC could do what ever and it wouldn't make a difference. And again, that is not what LRC is for.",1637668063,hlrabqq
"LRC would still have to be bought at Coin markets. The price would spike. Shorts have to foot the bill regardless, GME shareholders get 7x of that LRC spike on top of GME Short being forced to close out. Sounds like a hell of a short squeeze to me.",1637667724,hlr9vtc
"“Issue”? Did they not already set a precedent in court two years ago that such a dividend is issuable? Given the growth of interest and use of Coins in the last two years, Gamestop should theoretically have a stronger case of why LRC is to be issued, especially if a business platform/partnership warranted the move. Overstock was more of a “fuck you Shorts, try and pay *this*” move. Gamestop would be creating a foundation for their user base and ventures moving into 2022.",1637667390,hlr9fw3
"That would put Gamestop in the same boat with Overstock when they offered crypto currency.  It did force a small squeeze but the courts became involved.  Even with the somewhat favorable rulings afterwards, it really didn't have the effect that was intended.  If Gamestop wanted to offer a crypto currency, they could just use fractions of bitcoin and not be bothered with LRC.  Seems like that would be an easier path for them.",1637667372,hlr9f38
"In your scenario, SHF would just pay the cash equivalent value of LRC. Either on date of payment or possibly the record date. Besides that's not the purpose of LRC. It's a utility token meant to be staked",1637667330,hlr9d23
"I never said an NFT dividend. I’m saying a cry.pt0 dividend, LRC being said coin.",1637667124,hlr939v
"If it was LRC we would have the same issue that Overstock had with their crypto dividend, right? I think the play here if there’s a dividend would be an NFT.",1637666994,hlr8xew
"That's not really how LRC fits into this.  LRC is a coin for Loopring, the company.  An NFT offered by Gamestop is its own unique thing, not simply a LRC.  The hedgies can't just buy LRC and give it as a dividend.  Only Gamestop can ""create"" a NFT so the hedgies have no way to buy them to distribute as a dividend.  That is why they are so absolutely fucked with a NFT dividend.  Their only course of action is to buy back all the shares so they do not have to provide dividends to individual retail share owners.",1637666921,hlr8tzw
LRC doesn’t make sense as the dividend,1637666652,hlr8hra
"Napkin math on why I think a 7:1 LRC dividend announcement would be a Shorts killer. 

Total GME Outstanding Shares (Yahoo): 76M shares
Float: 61M shares

Loop.ring Coin current price: $2.75/LRC

In January 2021, per the SEC, GME was shorted over 200% the Float. 228% if I remember correctly. Let’s say 200% to be conservative. If, as theorized, this short percentage has been can-kicked and hidden (ie Shorts never closed), we can suspect roughly 122M shares are synthetics, coupled with the 61M float for a total of roughly 183M shares. Now if Gamestop issues a 7:1 (Tinfoil hat time: 741 has been cryptically repeating in various forms) LRC dividend for every GME, shorts are on the hook to pay dividends for every synthetic. Or, roughly 122M synthetic GME shares. 

Now comes the fun maths. 122M GME x 7 x $2.75= $2.3485B. Not a bad chunk of change to gut punch short positions. But the kicker is exponential price growth. Not ever LRC bought will cost just $2.75... as Shorts are forced and scramble to close their positions to cover the LRC costs, LRC starts to rise. Coupled with regular retail buying, LRC should spike drastically. This should flag mainstream media to report on the LRC spike and people will begin to see Gamestop news partnered with Loop. Let the FOMO begin. The beautiful part is, while Shorts are on the hook for 7:1 LRC dividend, they are having to buy back those synthetic GME shares on the open market. It’s a Nazi Germany being hit on both fronts. LRC spikes and racks up a huge bill for the Shorts, AND GME moonshots as Shorts buy back. Retail sees the huge GME spike and it’s Jan ‘21 2.0...starting at higher levels. 

A drastic spike in LRC (and we GME shareholders having a piece of the 1.3B LRC pie) would put LRC on the Internet Coin map. A possible ET.H contender (see current price)? Now Gamestop would be having to front a dividend on 61M float, but if that LRC is already locked up, it’s chump change for Gamestop. In other words, Shorts r fuk.",1637666325,hlr82z7

The reason I got into GME in the first place was getting plastered over Thanksgiving since I didn't go home and was bored. 

I already knew of W - S - B, but I was pretty fiscially responsible. Then I spent 2-3 days immersed in it. Everyone was talking about GME so I bought some and flipped it a few days later. I think I traded in and out a few times.

Then I actually read the full DD and watched DFV and have been ballz deep ever since.

I could have retired at 38 at the $300+ levels if I just held from the  beginning.

"If I were in RC’s position, I would want to wait until strong Q3 and Q4 earnings are released. This would show the market GME isn’t fucking around and is making the fundamental changes to be a titan in a multi-billion dollar video game industry. Couple that with a release of a LRC/NFT platform that could be a game changer would start the hype machine. 

 These factors, imo, would prime a split, so when investors see a $40-ish entry point they would go ape shit and we would squeeze out the ass. Given that RC’s lockout period is coming to an end, a 7:1 split and $40 price point could allow him to drop a cool $1B to buy up 25M shares, add to his 9(?)M current shares. Having 34M shares of a stock with a strong $200-250 support ain’t bad of a return. And being a chairman of a growth tech company in Gamestop is a fat cherry on top.",1637637596,hlq3hbq

"There's a virtually guaranteed partnership to happen between GME and LRC to create an NFT marketplace. 

LRC is also an undervalued crypto that solves a majority of the problems with ETH. There's a potential 5x+ upside if this can bring LRC into the top 10 market caps. 

I'm strictly a crypto investor but this announcement has got my tits entirely jacked and seeing all the support from apes is heartwarming.

"Loopring will either be the latest proof of this or the exception to the rule, but it's a great example.

LRC comes up in our subs as being related to GS in some meaningful fashion.

LRC goes up from 0.75 to 2.30ish.

LRC people pay they buying gme - if they are it's likely off LRC gains, but I haven't seen any proof they actually have.

LRC goes up to 3.20

LRC starts to lose traction in subs, starts falling back to... 2.30 as of this post.

Another example, but more likely accidental than on purpose would be blockbuster and sears - how many apes holding bankrupt companies thanks to that one post?",1637268403,hl61eft

"The NFT “conf” was a one time thing, clear miscalculation on promoting it. Nothing overly nefarious. 

What you’re indicating would be nefarious on Loopring’s part. Let’s be logical, Loopring builds tools to enable Web3, the future essentially. Then proceeds to fraud a core audience for a short term pump of LRC? While destroying all credibility going forward? 

I think you have to think outside of your own thought processes and better examine long term incentives of Loopring, I.e., it would make no sense to essentially build brilliantly only to let your “marketing” to destroy it",1637265668,hl5ugr0

"Okay. This is the part of the evidence that finally seals the deal for me ahead of an official announcement. It's hosted directly and the only alternative to a legit connection between GME and LRC at this point would be complete compromise of GameStop's main domain internet security, which is I suppose possible but I can't understand the mentality that would lead someone to hack in seamlessly only to add in a link to a crypto.

So... should we be buying LRC?,1637256475,hl57113
"Start off by saying:    
Because this post is disingenuous.  There hasn't been any actual press release.  I got excited for a bit and now I'm a little PO'd that the title lied to me.  


Speculation/Possible reasons (for all crypto really):

* Evergrande bankruptcy
   * On Nov 10th,  the fake news rumor that it was happening was enough to stop LRC rocket in it's tracks. 
   * Evergrande can only delay the inevitable for so long.  People might be pre-emptively pulling out. 
* Infrastructure Bill that was signed Monday is bad for Crypto
   * Just when LRC started rebounding, this dropkicked it back below $3
* A 3rd reason...  I don't want everyone to know because then my strat may not work as well. I'll just say it will probably reach maximum dip tomorrow to 10AM Sat before taking on bullish signs again next week. If it doesn't... Then buckle up until possibly January.",1637256450,hl56ypj

"Can't you do it with MATIC that you buy on exchange and deposit to a polygon wallet? I'm assuming that Polygon let you use their coin for NFTs on their blockchain for OpenSea transactions.

Matic is a great coin to hold anyway, I was holding it until I went balls deep on LRC. 

And this makes the assumption that GameStop's system will be any better. Loopring layer 2 is still built on ETH so could have many of the same problems.",1637255548,hl54o5x
Tough to believe LRC can be a rug pull with barely any media hyping it,1637254689,hl52hby
"They're rich and already bought huge amounts of LRC. They then set up to sell some huge amounts of LRC, which causes the price to drop because so many are being sold. This causes investors to panic sell their LRC, dropping the price further thus allowing said rich people to buy more at a lower price. If that sounds familiar that's because it is, it's the same psychological warfare the hedgefunds and other rich people have been doing on the stock market forever.

The cure is the same as the stock market. Buy, hold, DRS. You can't DRS your crypto but you can store it in a secure wallet.

Dips are scary, but in the long term are nothing unless a crypto is a rugpull... but nothing about LRC seems like a rugpull to me. Too much work has been put in for too long, and there's too much evidence of one of the biggest partnerships the crypto world has ever seen, for me to believe it's a rugpull or that the price is going down because of investor sentiment.",1637253902,hl50gne

It just seems like rather suddenly there's been a lot of talk about buying LRC and it's gains, which is fine and fantastic it's not really my business how you spend your money. But I feel like that kind of stuff is better suited for the LoopRing sub rather than a GME centric sub. I don't think buying LRC somehow takes away from GME, it just don't see it being proper content for the sub.",1636505128,hk0b07p

I put a whole big pile of $40 (so, like, who tf cares) in LRC for two reasons: I felt like it, and I want more experience with crypto. I'm not buying BC, because how silly is it to only be able to buy 0.000001 of a coin, and LRC is friendly as a company and easy to purchase based on price.

So Matt and who knows how many others at GME or GME itself, are hodling LRC.

Wonder if RC was like, shittt, we got a ton of $$ just from LRC going up.

Is RC confirming that they are both HOLDING GME and HODLING LRC?

Also, DRS your shares, ya shits!",1636504228,hk08z91
I’m talking about L2. Once fiat on ramping happens the ability to have next to no gas costs is amazing. Right now there isn’t a good reason to use the mobile app and pay for a L1 contract to use L2. LRC has a counterfactual wallet coming any day that will allow fiat on ramping direct to L2. So no more buying crypto on L1 then spending gas to move it to L2.,1636503934,hk08bnl
"I just want to hear a convincing argument for why LRC pumping is good for GME. It's entirely possible I don't understand enough about crypto and NFTs to be able to logically connect LRC to GME, so if someone who does could explain it to me I'd really appreciate it.

Now from what I understand-ish is LoopRing's L2 is a method to exchange one crypto (unsure if restricted to Eth based or BC based or open to all) for another, without the need for a central exchange like CoinBase or Binance. Having this capability reduces gas fees associated with the transactions because rather than having to sell crypto on an exchange incurring a transaction fee, and then buying the other crypto on an exchange incurring another transaction fee, it utilizes it's zkRollup magic process that enables coins to change wallets via a third wallet intermediary or something? So if that is true, and is the case, LRC pumping just means it takes less LRC to buy other coins with it.

For GameStop's NFT marketplace, it's enabling the creation, and trading of NFTs whose value is Eth based, utilizing LoopRing's L2 as the basis of the marketplace so people in that ecosystem to can mint NFTs and then sell/buy/trade them without incurring high gas fees. So unless GameStop hamstrings itself and doesn't allow NFT trading with any Eth based coin other than LRC, I still don't see how LRCs value increasing does anything for GameStop.

I've noticed a lot of people insinuating LRC derives it's value from LoopRing's valuation so LoopRing partnering with GameStop makes LoopRing more valuable thus making LRC more valuable. But how? Does buying and holding LRC give you a piece of LoopRing? I thought BC's value was based on scarcity and utility. What makes LRC more valuable than a meme coin other than a bunch of people piling in on it causing demand? What's it's utility?",1636503778,hk07z21
"Bought some more LRC (loopring) yesterday and planning to add more to it this week, LFG!

GME + LRC = dream combo!",1636503712,hk07tpv
"Yeah it has a perfect storm around it. A lot of pumping crypto projects are just valueless to be honest. But to have something legit and have a future despite some quick action, along with GME people getting into crypto and crypto people understanding the GME saga more because of all of this ... It's a good situation.

edit: I think a lot of people are getting hit with LRC news too much though, based on comments. I get it. But ethereum is literally the basis for the future of finance (not all of it, there are other chains, but the majority of it? yes).",1636503487,hk07bld

Imagine a digital Gamestop storefront, where you could buy, sell and trade game licenses across *platforms*. Buy I dunno, Sims 5 on playstation... but want the license on your pc instead? Gameloops got you. Want to buy a friend a copy of a game but don't know which platform they want it on? No problem, here's an nft of this license. This could also revolutionize DRM. Since it's non fungible tokens, it can't be spoofed. No more denuovo or epic or valve saying they have to certify your licenses all the time... one and done, baby.

"None of my comments are based on it making a difference in the shorts overall. 

My comments are regarding observations and what I suspect is going on with certain price movements. 

Does it matter? Maybe in understanding the markets and tactics used in the market.

Does price action matter with GME?

I don’t think the success of LRC is dependent on shorter interference or price action generally, and personally agree that both will succeed due to what they will produce separately and together.

But newcomers to crypto and the markets in general might benefit from learning about shorting and recognizing it as it’s occurring if it’s occurring… rather than getting fleeced like has been the general operating features of the markets for (I suspect) a long time.

"Imo LRC is definitely being shorted and has the appearance / activity of an ongoing squeeze, also helped by apes piling in / liking the coin.

If you try to suggest that on the LRC subreddit though you’ll get called an idiot. 

I’ve watched gme and other squeeze action long enough to at least suspect LRC is squeezing.

Additionally, you’re right as far as everyone shouts coins can’t be shorted but a 5 second google search will more than clarify that they can be shorted.

And honestly do all these investors think that some party whether private or institutional wouldn’t think they could outsmart / outplay one of the fastest growing cryptos and consider it “over-valued”?

Anyone who doesn’t at least entertain this as a possibility has very little experience or working practical knowledge of the market structure… because the answer is of course there are likely to be people or institutions attempting to make money shorting all kinds of forms of cryptos. Not only that, larger institutions are probably using ladder type attacks and computers calculating derivatives based on volume and buy / sell orders to attempt to figure out when to short / cover / buy.

People who fancy themselves hot day traders will feel confident about the TA abilities but at the end of the day they’re too narrow minded and short sighted to realize super computers and algos are going to do a much better job with TA and prediction than their basic pattern recognition and line drawing…. Especially when large financial institutions have the capital to make price action happen with large volumes at basically any time they want.

Not financial advice… 

And good luck convincing anyone in either forum that L R - Coin is squeezing or subject to standard shorting practices throughout the market. The shorters don’t want anyone discussing these practices and half the people in that subreddit are in denial that shorting of crypto even exists. But why wouldn’t it?

"Let me share my experience with loopring with you. 

I have absolutely no experience with crypto or the difference between L1 and L2 prior to this. 

I wanted to buy some LRC to go with my GME shares. Recently I had my home broken into and most of my things stolen, including my wallet that had my drivers license. Luckily I still had my passport because it was in my car not my home. 

So I tried to create a coin base account, but they could not verify my id with my passport because they wanted my physical address. I was able to get approved, but until I could provide a utility bill I Can’t buy. So buying LRC was off the table there. 

Next up was crypto.com but they refuse to update my verification despite me giving the correct documents. 

So next i found that bitstamp accepts passports as verification so I signed up and got approved to buy. Except they don’t sell LRC, so I bought ETH and transferred it to a MetaMask wallet so that I could move the eth to an exchange I could buy LRC. 

This is where loopring came in and my lack of understanding towards L1 and L2. I connected my MM wallet to loopring.io and bought LRC using their layer2 app with my eth. 

Later, I decided that I wanted the security of loopring and I wanted to use it on mobile. So I decided to check out their wallet. When I went to create a wallet it needs money to create the wallet and pay for the gas. When it asked how I wanted to pay I chose LRC because.. you know I just bought some.  

I sent the LRC I just bought to the address and.. nothing happened. This was when I learned that I needed to send LRC through layer1 to create the contract and then I would have access to layer2. So essentially I had to send the same amount to layer1 and the previous coins I sent would be in my wallet. 

But remember I can’t purchase L1 LRC because 3 different exchanges gave me problems and I could only purchase using Loopring. 

I ended up (with the help of a loopring dev) forcing the LRC L2 in my wallet to exchange to L1 (costing me 0.05 eth in gas fees and using those LRC coins to create the wallet. I essentially spent almost $500 to create a $140 wallet. Once it was created the wallet glitched and won’t open properly within the app. 

When I reached out to the dev he said it’s a glitch with the current version of Loopring and they have extensively test the next version coming out. When I asked when the new version is released he said in two days. 

The point of all this, is he was reluctant to say when the next version was released, but they are releasing it on Monday. If we have an announcement next week why would they have multiple versions to release in the same week?

Also if you look at the banner countdown it there was four days since the MP 2 and six days between GoG 3 and the MP2 banner. I speculate that the next banner will change on Monday or be announced because the next countdown should be in two days. Which matches the Loopring update.",1635622285,hiogr12

I’m still reading their white sheet to grasp it, but there’s a lot of math.  Anyways, you have to stake both because (from what I understand, could be wrong) is that they localized values.  If sally is selling 10 LRC (A) for 2 ETH (B) you have a value of 5.  If someone is buying 8 LRC for 1 ETH, you have a value of 8.  5 &lt; 8 so the trade wouldn’t work, but if it were flipped, 8 &gt; 5, trade would execute.",1635610427,hinodxt

"I feel like we are agreeing here. You seem to be disagreeing, but your points kind of agree with my points.

    1. A sent transaction is not meant as being received

Yeah, that's my point. Those transactions can be from anyone, as you also said. That is why I sent some LRC myself, and now we can see the transaction listed under ownership of the GameStop NFT address.

I can't really get into arguing the rest, because I don't really have the energy to. I am not saying the etherscan page isn't showing Loopring Coins (LRC), because it definitely is. The main takeaway here, which you seem to agree with from point 1, is that anyone could have sent Loopring Coin to the GameStop NFT address, as I have done myself. It is definitely the official LRC, but the sender was not Loopring. Looping was just the type of token sent in the transaction from a CB wallet.

Let's try this.. start at the [GameStop NFT address page](https://etherscan.io/address/0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e) that you originally linked. Instead of clicking Loopring (LRC) in the token dropdown, click Sheeb, or any of the other tokens listed. Those have all been sent to the GameStop NFT address, and all appear in a similar way to the LRC transaction view. Where the logic breaks down is- you are saying you can click LRC in the dropdown and that proves the link, but that means all of the other tokens listed would have to be linked as well. They are all just different types of tokens, each with their official pages linked in the info box once you click them. Where am I misunderstanding there?",1635544062,hikgacf
"cc u/peteszahh and  and /u/I-Argue-With-Myself 

It could be about the Ethereum network upgrade Altair that rolled out Wednesday. Last I checked 98.7% nodes have upgraded. 

For those not familiar - This is good news for ETH, but don't be mistaken it's also good news for GME! 

LRC is great tech and gasless NFTs will be a huge deal, but it still has to interface with the rest of the blockchain. Imagine LRC as a fiber intranet and ETH as a 300 baud network that LRC has to use to communicate externally. Altair is an infrastructure update on the way toward fiber.

"u/3for100Specials We are with you, not against you. I have included a few points below on why it is 99% likely that the last 3 transactions listed aren't from Loopring.

1. The last transaction was me. I did a test by sending LRC to the GME address. I tried to send $2.69, but it ended up being $2.68. I sent this through my regular CB account (not Pro). Anyone, literally anyone, is welcome to try this themselves. You can send any ERC-20 based token to the address listed on the GameStop NFT website.
2. The page that has the 'Official Site:' listed as [https://loopring.org/](https://loopring.org/) is correct. You are viewing the blockchain page for the Loopring token, filtered by transactions with the GameStop NFT address. Try [this link](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbbbbca6a901c926f240b89eacb641d8aec7aeafd), which isn't filtered by the GameStop address, and shows all of the Loopring token transactions. The official site listed isn't proving that the transaction address is tied to the Loopring website. It's just showing the official site for the token for the page you are viewing.
3. Loopring would not use a 3rd party service, especially Coinbase, to send tokens to GameStop. They have their own wallet service. They would just send directly from it.
4. To further prove point 2, select Shib in the dropdown instead of LRC. Here is a link to that page: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x95aD61b0a150d79219dCF64E1E6Cc01f0B64C4cE?a=0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e](https://etherscan.io/token/0x95aD61b0a150d79219dCF64E1E6Cc01f0B64C4cE?a=0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e). It also has a link to the official sheeb website, but that in no way means that the Sheeb company/organization is tied to GameStop.

I would love to have a calm debate if any of my points above are invalid. Ape no fight ape.",1635526938,hij928d

1 buy lrc on CB

2 copy the code you get from your wallet to receive the lrc from CB

3 go to CB (if you deposit it’ll take like 5 business days for full LRC to be transferable), to your LRC in portfolio and “withdraw”. Then choose crypto account, at too paste the address on where sending to. Transfer your available lrc.  

4 go to your LOopring wallet and those funds should appear in your L1 wallet (guess you can’t Transfer from CB wallet to L2.. yet). 

5 click on the L1 wallet to see your lrc, then hit “move” on that screen, you should an option of L1, to L2.  Presto. 

6. If you want. And have some eth (I do), then you can stake/AMM your LRC into a pool.  Basically earn a bit of lrc. 

*for example, I have 626 lrc + .17 eth “staking” in a pool. Since maybe monday? And have this earned a “whopping” $6 just sitting there.

So GS buys LRC at $.20 word gets out it's the GS dividend and the price shoots up to $100, now the brokers are handing out $100 bills per share, which in turn everyone buys more GME with the cash, then DRS's or straight up reinvests in CS.

"First off, regarding software dev, total smooth brain here. But i read the Gemini article about AMM’s after you said it was interesting and it led to a bunch of questions. 

In AMM’s, liquidity providers contribute to a liquidity pool to stabilize pricing and facilitate buying and selling. For this they get paid a fee. A couple weeks ago an ape posted a video of Matt Finestone presenting about Loopring back in 2019. Here he refers to AMMs and Uniswap as essentially a store model where the price is set and you can take it or leave it. 

Now, presumably in the GameStop marketplace there will be an underlying currency; eth, lrc, or some sort of gme token that can be used to purchase items. Does that mean individuals will be able to “invest” in the underlying currency by purchasing it and providing it to liquidity pools and thus earning an interest rate or ROI? It also potentially opens up the possibility to do something similar in a finacial market. Currently brokers receive a fee to lend our stocks out to large institutions, while we are left with an IOU and no benefit to the loan. Could this provide an opportunity for hodlers to collect a fee in such a system as well? It seems like the same scenario as the store-based mode described above. 

Also in the Matt Finestone presentation he makes the distinction of the AMM model and the order book mode created by Loopring. After reading about AMMs, it seems like that would be the better choice for a retail marketplace and the type of inventory gme currently sells. So why is Loopring and an order book style system apparently the leading system being implemented in the gme nft marketplace? What types of transactions are an order book system best suited for besides financial exchanges? I’m not insinuating that they must be building a financial DEX, I just can’t figure out how that system will be used outside of that application and why it is the best option. 

Can any wrinkly apes provide educated speculation or maybe clarity on how orderbook systems can be used in retail applications?",1636217801,hjkj1bl
I have absolutely no idea about crypto or blockchain tbh but I converted a fair amount of my crypto holdings into LRC just in case something otherworldly happens and it moons like Bitcoin or something. No cash was spent on these transactions so please don’t crucify me.,1636217434,hjki5yo

&amp;#x200B;

This kind of explains the technology loopring uses, why it's important, and you can get a sense of the tokenomics near the end of the loopring whitepaper. Some stuff in the white paper may be a little complicated but don't worry just try your best to get the concepts. Tokenomics are still a newer concept but I would say they are important to understand if you are looking to invest in crypto. Also I know people have differing opinions on Gary Gensler but his class on crypto was a fantastic source of information in my opinion.  


For example, LRC tokenomics would be that it has a token burn mechanic. People who trade on the network pay fees, those fees are converted to LRC by an algo and ""burned"" meaning they are removed from the total supply of LRC, think stock buy backs.

&amp;#x200B;

 With LRC you also have a DAO, which is decentralized autonomous organization. So as a token holder you can vote on changes to the Loopring system. These are usually done through a process where propositions are voted on by taking your LRC and putting them in a smart contract to distinguish your vote. There are usually limits on DAOs where you have to have a certain size stake in order to make propositions, but anyone can vote by using these smart contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

So when you buy LRC you are buying a token that gives you a voting share in the loopring system and benefits directly from fees generated by the system. People can use Loopring without owning LRC. But likely if GME is using Loopring as their infrastructure for their marketplace people will be paying fees that the system will convert to LRC and burn.  


Hope some of this helped. I encourage you to try and get through some of that whitepaper and just google what you can to help grow that understanding because that is how we all start. So it takes some time but it's worth because it will give you more conviction on your investments.",1636207218,hjjuqcg

"We could get GME coins, LRC is not meant to be ""THE"" exchange token necessarily, Daniel Wang (founder of Loopring) said they provide the protocols, they don't aim to become a platform.",1638449117,hmxbitz
Under gme coin you mean LRC ?,1638448312,hmxa7o2
"I’d imagine it’s separate from the tradable LRC and not included, as indicated by the LRC-TEST naming.",1638447594,hmx933a
"sounds reasonable... Otherwise, would that amount of tokens hanging out in a wallet cause, like mass price dilution? Asking for a friend who just bought the LRC dip today.",1638446844,hmx7yqo

"**Actually... no, quite the contrary. It is all about the numbers and research.**

I think the key is to look for so called **asymmetric investments**.

An example: A friend approached me a few days ago and wanted to hear my personal opinion about investing a few thousand dollars into the b-coin.

We did the math: since it is a small amount of money and his goal was ""life changing"" money, he needed at least 10000% ROI (return on investment).

**B-coin would have to reach 6M USD** for that to happen. Yeah, sure.

**GME would have to reach over 20k** in a squeeze (Gateway Industries had f.e. a 20000% increase and that was no infinity squeeze at all)

**LRC would have to reach over 300 USD** (b-coin market cap is 300x larger than LRC, so there is for sure some potential)

**Pretty obvious our conclusion was, that GME is the most asymmetric investment by far.** LRC is a pretty asymmetric investment as well. And the b-coin is the total opposite of an asymmetric investment. Once you are buying after a massive RIP, the potential is meh and the risk to be a bag holder is massive. It was a good asymmetric investment for early adopters, though.

**Once we did the math, it was evident to him, how silly he was to even think of investing into b-coin.** He will likely put his money into GME instead, if we will not moon before, since he will have the money available next year and wants to make up his mind over the XMas holidays.

No financial advice, just a personal opinion. But I hope the logic behind asymmetric investing can help retail investors to make reasonable investment decisions.",1638444001,hmx427w

"I've done a TON of personal dd, and you can find snippets in my post history but it's buried underneath loopring hype lol. Unfortunately the mvis sub isn't as welcoming to meme speak and ""crazy""/speculative theories...but if you look through old comments any of the exceptionally long ones pre-lrc have some of the information.

So part of the reason is lack of audience, and also I'm just not as good as some of the smart ones around here. I'm add af, so I'm AWESOME at finding and soaking up information to build my own 'big picture' but when it comes to explaining it to others I tend to muck up the details. 

However with everything happening lately, I might have to find some information this weekend and see what I can put together.

I guess to give you an idea of my theory, there were 3 stocks mentioned by jeffries&amp;Co. 

Gme, movies, and mvis.

Gme the cat was not going to go back in the bag. (I do hold some and wish I knew what I know now, as I would've loaded up instead of taking an L at 40) 

popcorn is, and always has been, a distraction. they pump and dump at will to balance their collateral requirements (along with...the entire market at this point. 

microvision though...they hold a key component to Microsofts hololens, which is being used by the US military. That's why I got in. 

They have  essentially gone silent in regards to that, and started marketing themselves as a lidar company, with plenty of links to...well the entire auto industry, along with basically any kind of old and too big to fail tech firms. So basically auto and tech goliaths are like 2/3 of the global economy...so 2/3 of the baddies net worth. 

I mean of all the meme stocks this year, that seems like the most solid bet to me...yet they are suspiciously completely ignored when it comes to meme stock discussions. That should be reason enough to raise some eyebrows.",1638394240,hmujy36

It came from Leochan's fork who works on other Loopring code and he, sylvanas and winda commonly work on a number of files together. Leochan's fork was their workplace before the merged their code into the master branch. She merged the wrong one by mistake and then made it private. 

I'm bullish on the NFT stuff with LRC and GME but I wish people would research more. Lastly, the code has no ""resurfaced"" anywhere, **ANYWHERE** on the official Loopring git, it has only been made visible again, for whatever reason.

I basically f5'd all of their pages for a week straight to know this. I even have proof of Loopring addresses pointing to the only Gamestop related contracts on etherscan that were promptly removed from their Git and hidden so you can't see them anymore.

"Yes.  I've even been on Looprings L2 with a wallet for a month.  In fact they have a lot of stuff set up.  I've been during the same time a liquidity provider or Automated Market Maker for a combination ETH-LRC investment where people like me serve as automated (more honest) market makers with their code.  Instead of staking my coin I provide liquidity and gain a small percent in fees from transactions between those coins.  In a month since I put in 13,000$ in that account it's gone up to 33,000 (because it went from 0.8$ to \~3$, but what's cool is that I even made \~1,300$ in new LRC coins and ETH from the fees of letting my coins sit there.

There are risks to becoming an AMM though and this isn't something to just dive in like I did (because I did the same thing on an unknown coin with over 100% APR interest projected....but it was someone gaming the system and I got burnt there, lost 8k).

Sorry for rambling.  YES you can get an L2 (layer two) wallet currently from LoopRing, but it is not the counterfactual wallet.  I had to pay something like $300 bucks to create my L2 wallet and I not only payed too much gas but was retarded about how I moved all my money there and wasted so much extra gas.  Unless you truly want to beat the rush to get onto L2 and investigate in ways you personally understand the DD to invest--like you want to get onboard and try our crypto and AMM or such I'd otherwise just wait for the counterfactual wallet or buy some LRC on coinbase and send it to a MetaMask account (you can also link a metamask account to Loopring and create a L2 wallet currently for the cost or always create it from there whenever Looprings counterfactual wallet comes out.",1638381699,hmtn1gs

RC almost undoubtedly browses this sub (it's been shown multiple times through him reposting things on twitter that originate here). and so even if the Tuesday Morning theory was beyond tinfoil, I believe even if there was an announcement that might've been planned to be on a Monday (i.e., the Loopring partnership), they would bump up a day later just based on satisfying the shareholders / LRC investors

it's become a self-fulfilling prophecy

"Banks exist because people needed a safe place to store their money.

Now with the advent of crypto, you can just have a wallet online that is as secure as a bank account (arguably more secure) but crypto doesn't do a lot of things banks can do.

Like you can't just swipe a card at an ATM or grocery store to buy things and have it debit your crypto account (at least for most wallets)


What lrc is building is a wallet and exchange that will have all the same functionality as a bank, minus the fees and central control and fuckery.



You just have an account online- your wallet- where your money is safe (thanks Blockchain)

Then you use your loopring debit card at any store or atm- just like any other debit card. Loopring will seamlessly exchange your loops for whatever currency you need when it makes payment.

North doing this would cost a ton of gas fees because most cryptos use the etherium network, but lrc bypasses gas fees and does this for basically free.


They also bypass the speed problem of Ethereum network.



It will probably happen in phases and will take time, but lrcs mission from the beginning has been to allow users to be their own banks. We no longer need financial mega institutions to keep our money secure. The Blockchain can do this for us. 

The banks won't even believe it's possible until it's already too late 




So to answer op, you won't need to find a bank for your post MOASS tendies, because Ryan Cohen and LRC are building a decentralized bank. And it's going to have millions of rich ass apes as it's first adopters.",1639964333,hp8pzj2
"Right but we're talking about LRC right? That's the context of this thread. In order to buy LRC you have to use a certain type of other coin that I've forgotten at this point, something mask or something. You only can get either if these through Coinbase (that I know of) and can only buy them with ETH. You then have to transfer said ETH to Flexa, except I didn't know about Flexa so I transferred my LRC to my Loopring wallet, the L1 wallet because you can't transfer LRC from Coinbase directly to L2. In order to send LRC to Flexa it must be in your L2 wallet or else you convert it to ETH, either way you're paying gas fees when instead I could've just used ETH to begin with.

If I'm some dude off the street, Im literally going to drive to GameStop and buy my game with Fiat, I'm not waisting time with all the other nonsense.

That's my point, if we want this to work in a widespread way it has to be at least on par with how easy Fiat transactions are or this isn't going to work when most smooth brain, impatient retards, are like me and just want to buy a game or something.",1639964092,hp8php3

I know peer-to-peer lending is still fairly new, but I know I would love to explore the opportunity - post-MOASS - to fill that gap for personal loan funding to other private citizens.

And since I could feasibly sink millions into this sort of loan and not need anything in return, I think a no- to low-interest loan would be great. Payments back don't come to me, either - they'd go directly back into the fund (alongside any interest) to replenish and allow it to be lent out again. 

Especially considering the ""be your own bank"" sentiment from LRC, I wonder if the new defi blockchain system would make it easier to accomplish.

Imagine - banks lock out their customers, and an invisible, anonymous DAO pops up to offer no/low interest loans to help them get on their feet. With returned funds going back out immediately. No profits, no executives to pay out.

Yes. Yes.

We know there is only 1 GME. We are all aware. I'm a holder as well. 

.However. 

If they (GME and others) use companies and network ecosystems to facilitate the adoption of crypto, meeting demands of the  new generation of gaming and online ownership ect.

 Why wouldn't they be using well thoughtout, less expensive to use, solid projects to bring them into the next realm?

 This would be projects like LRC and flexa network to be the highway of transactions that process very quickly, low fees and high security of decentralization. 
Add the low risk (AMP *flexas native token* provides insurance for transactions amongst other features)

You now have a giant like GME, who now has the ability to be up to date processing 10s of thousands of transactions a second at a low cost to both merchant and consumer through the LRC network while now being able to concor the impending crash when USD goes to shit?

"The L1 is like the main 'blockchain' and when a transaction happens, a fee is charged, compensating computational effort of the computers that power crypt0. It would be like if you went to a store and paid in cash, then got charged a fee by the teller for counting and handling your cash.

Level 2 (zkRollup), in my understanding, is a method of circumventing the computational load on L1. It bundles several transactions (6000?) into one and does the crypt0 computation, which is later validated by L1, then included in the blockchain.

You know how we have digital games that we can download. Can't really sell those right now, can we? Something back by a blockchain would allow transfer of digital assets like this. Your 'cd key' to a game is unique, non-fungible, and ownership of it can be transferred. Ownership can be validated by another system, like the PS network, or Xbox.

Also, as an asset is transferred and recorded, it's also possible for a portion of that transfer value to go back to the creator. So, game developers could continue to profit of used game sales. Or, a 3d modeler could be compensated for a well liked and often purchased cosmetic or skin. Or voice packs. Or there could be a limited number of cosmetics released for a game and only available through a specific retailer. Tons of possibilities!

A big pain point for crypt0 has been the 'gas' fees, want to transfer $20? That's a $20 fee. Want to transfer $1M? that's a $20 fee.

For smaller transfers, or transactions of data, the fees are prohibitive. zkRollup should solve it.

I don't know about the need for owning LRC or other crypt0. Maybe it's a bit like wanting to own a gas station because you drive a car. Maybe not quite, but kinda. There is value in the crypt0 but also in the service they provide. The thing I think about is that for them to be used as a currency, they need to have a stable value. If they increase in value too highly, the 'gas' prices for many also increase, so their utility good down. They become less accessible for vendors.

A DEX, combined with a stable coin, combined with low fees, that would be great. I hope that's the aim here.

Oof, this rambling got long.

For mom and pop, it's like a gold backed dollar (DEX), a checkbook balance sheet or ledger (for ownership), and royalties on everything, with low overhead fees for servicing.",1639111425,hny6bqu

These NFTs can be freely traded between players, similar to trade ins, but the difference is every single transaction pays some small % to GameStop and some small % to the game creators.

Its very widely distributed among many actors. 

That doesn't mean coin and blockchain are issue-free. But they have the potential to flip the script on banks and that's why it's interesting.

"Hey all, remember that we dedicated stockholders know a lot about GameStop's NFT marketplace despite the company not giving any official news, but I still think we will be in for a surprise when we see the NFT Marketplace. I didn't mention this in the post, but I believe based on Dami's tweets that GameStop will also at some point release a mobile app for their NFT marketplace, which will be another game changer.

Also, as promised in the post, I will attempt to explain ETH layer 1 and LRC layer 2 as I understand it using a metaphor:

Imagine ETH is like a congested blockchain city because it’s so popular for its security and smart contracts and tech. In fact, it’s so popular that you gotta pay a $100 gas fee to get to just to buy a $3 cup of coffee. It’s so expensive that you decide to just not go to the city at all. Then, Loopring came along and built a high speed monorail elevated train called ZKrollup. Now hundreds of people (or hundreds of transactions) can fit into one section (one rollup) of the train, and the gas fees are split across multiple transactions rather than paying a fee for each transaction, effectively eliminating gas fees. So Loopring solves the problem of high fees ($0 gas fees) and improves the transactions per second (ETH has 13 transactions per second, whereas Loopring has tps is in the thousands and will soon be in the millions as tech like ETH 2.0 comes out) but Loopring still has the security of the popular ETH city, AND simultaneously this helps reduce congestion in ETH, reducing fees even more. And all that amazing technology is going to be adopted by GameStop.

Buckle up and DRS.

2- I never said it was, however, they are the first to garner a backing for their counterfactual wallet.  At least on the Ethereum blockchain.  I couldn’t find any other group that released anything like it.  Maybe you know of something I don’t.

3- this is a strange take.  I completely disagree.  SLGG totally was baseless speculation, but there is certainly more credibility to LRC partnership.  I think, if they are not partnered, then GameStop isn’t nearly as far along with the release as we think, and it may be many months until we see the marketplace.  If they partnered with Loopring, their counterfactual wallet will expedite the rollout of the marketplace, and help with adoption because of severely lowered gas fees and ease of use.

I’m not bashing you, I respect your opinion 100%.  I was just curious, really.",1639084375,hnwgnm8
"Wait, can I use LRC to buy direct now??? Am Canadian if that makes a difference",1639084217,hnwg9mv
"I think there is plenty of circumstantial evidence that links GME and Loopring. I also think GME is intentionally staying very tight-lipped about their strategy. 

Loopring may not be purely unique or truly revolutionary by way reducing gas fees without compromised security, but the organization and technology are uniquely poised to capitalize on this opportunity which GME is clearly pursuing. 

The writing is on the wall. Just because Loopring folks are a bit more loose lipped about the actual existence of a partnership doesn't mean that LRC is a distraction from DRSing GME. I doubt anyone here is nearly as balls deep in loops as they are in purple rings.",1639084158,hnwg4gc
"Hey boys hopped onto lrc and crypto in general when the gme rumors were announced.

Still don't know how to make my loopring wallet, I wasn't even aware they had already come out I thought it was delayed. How can I make one?",1639084127,hnwg1t5
"BTC isn't backed by Tether. 

Tether is a stablecoin which is used as the majority pairing coin for most trades/buys on the market, so people keep their ""fiat"" as USDT (Tether) to be able to buy the coins they want. The current fear is that Tether isn't actually backed by anything other than bad assets (for example, CP) and will crumble and wipe out a huge chunk of the market at once. There is obviously a lot of speculation in that, as no one can be 100% sure what Tether is ACTUALLY backed by, but I believe at some point stablecoins will become regulated and we'll find out :) Hopefully by then Terra or USDC has supplanted and flipped Tether lol.

&amp;#x200B;

BTC has value due to the nature of it being seen as an asset with scarcity and limited supply. It can be used for payments, and as of Taproot has some ""smart contract"" capabilities. The scarcity is the main thing and has led to the mass speculation turning it into a major player in asset market cap. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ethereum is a lot like BTC in many ways, but has some big departures in that it allows other applications to be ran off of its network, and be secured the same ""immutable"" ledger that Eth has. It can be used for payments, smart contracts, lets an application run off of it etc. All of this turns it into a very powerful tool where you can guarantee the information that an Ethereum app provides is true and has not been tampered with by a bad actor. Its major drawback is ""gas"" where everytime a transaction is run it costs ethereum to run the transaction. The normal transactions per second (TPS) is roughly 13 TPS. This has helped to place a premium on the cost of the transaction as the use of the ethereum network has skyrocketed the past few years. BTC, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche etc are all layer 1 technologies.

&amp;#x200B;

LRC, ZKSync, Immutable X and a few others are what are known as Layer 2 technologies. These use the Ethereum network as the primary form of security, but create a batch of all the transactions being ran at one time and submit that batched transaction to Ethereum for instant settlement and HUGELY reduced transaction fee. In Looprings case, it can be 100 times cheaper for transaction fees or even more. Loopring submits a batched ""smart contract"" with proof that all of the transactions inside of the smart contract are accurate to the Ethereum L1 via a technology called Zero-Knowledge Proof. This is essentially very complicated mathematical proofs, and I'm not going to go too in-depth, wikipedia or google has your answers if you want them.

The ultimate end goal here is to have a Decentralized Exchange which can have next to no transaction fees, is 100% secure and has no real way to have a bad actor come in. With On-ramps directly from fiat to L2 and from L2 off-ramp to Fiat this gets accomplished in a way which was previously not possible. In Conjunction with that, an alleged NFT marketplace can allow for seamless user experience in NFTs. Digital media is in a spot where it can be monetized by both the consumer AND the companies with smart contracts. Right now, when you buy a digital game, album, movie etc you essentially eat the full cost of ownership with no way to turn around later on and trade it in. With a fully featured NFT marketplace in the future, you could hypothetically buy your new copy of God of War with all your sweet pre-order / Special Edition perks as NFTs, and when done played sell your digital copy. That digital copy when re-sold can give the company which minted it a royalty fee, and the owner can recoup some of the cost of their game they no longer want. For consumers, this is actually a great thing.",1639083941,hnwflei
"1- I love the NFT marketplace, I have wet dreams over the possibilities, I use my imagination and I see a glorious, glorious thing. I talked about it on the stocks sub yesterday. Game developers, modders, artists, collectors, players, everyone will be able to exchange and share the profits and all that.

2- Loopring is not unique, and their protocol and technology is not one-of-a-kind.

3- LRC is a trap, the same as SLGG used to be, make it go real high, and then make it go down, and people will think it'll go up again, and then when people are invested in there, never make it higher than what it used to be. It's to relieve pressure on the shorts. 

4- The word is telegraph, though there is a choreography here.",1639083600,hnweqy6
"This is wild

VeVe is an NFT platform that I use and we’ve been waiting months for them to migrate their NFT’s onto Immutable X. Once that occurs we should be able to remove our collectibles from the app. Currently all of our stuff is only tradable in the VeVe platform.

Blah, the reason I’m even bringing up VeVe is because they won’t allow us to cash out fiat.

Currently you can only buy “gems” for $1 dollar apiece

Their NFT’s are bought and sold with these gems, and we’ve been eagerly awaiting the ability to flip our collectibles and cash out fiat.

They’ve been taking so incredibly long that some of us are wondering what the hold up is.

I’ve been following VeVe since March or April and the wait has been terrible. 

Seeing LRC testing their fiat ramp is incredibly bullish. If they launch this platform with GameStop and you can immediately cash out, they are going to dust VeVe lol

Don’t get me wrong. I’m incredibly bullish on VeVe for a multitude of reasons. But GME is my bottom bitch. Always will be. Always has been.",1639082993,hnwd9il

Last paragraph:

""_So what’s next. I am not leaving Loopring because I am tired of it, or because I am not interested in its future. I think you may see from my sappy message above, that is not the case. The fact is, an opportunity has presented itself that I am extremely excited about, and I feel I simply must take. I view it as a once-in-a-lifetime, perfect-timing, far-reaching opportunity/challenge that I need to pursue for its own sake, and for my personal development. I cannot give more information at the moment, but I will be sure to do so when the time is right — I hope on the order of a few months. This opportunity will keep me firmly in the blockchain (Ethereum) space, so I hope to be seeing many of you around real soon :)._

1) These developers lend their token shares out to be shorted

Because I read the DD about LRC and general market news and this post is directly about me? May I have an opinion other then yours?  Case in point right here,1640699486,hq9z15u
"There have been a colossal amount of hinting and winking that all point to one general idea: LRC is GME and GME is LRC.

The main supposition is that GameStop and Loopring are going in business together, and by logical inference this means the value of LRC will go up. 

The LRC pushers (I don't even know if it's Loopring itself), try to make it appear that Loopring and GameStop are close, but all of the signs 1- come from Loopring  2- come after something GameStop has said. 

So, the LRC pushers are riding the coattail of GME, using the same terminology (Tuesday mornings, takes money to buy whiskey, metaverse this and that) to make it appear they are close.

They will also use Matt Finestone, head of blockchain at GameStop as the proof that GameStop and Loopring are an item. I talk more about this here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rmjo27/if_loopring_announces_an_nft_marketplace_partner/hpoz8wj/

Something that would prove to me it is not an affinity scam is if GameStop does anything that would point towards them wanting to be with Loopring or doing a collab with Loopring.

So far, there have been 200 signs from the Loopring side towards GameStop and 0 signs from the GameStop side towards Loopring.

Sometimes people quote Larry Cheng's follows (he follows a thousand people on Twitter and was pretty clear he would be doing a long period of research on that topic) or the community head of GameStop (who follows 1500 people). 

But all in all, it's a confluence of 3 kinds of people pushing LRC

1- LRC bagholders who bought a $3+ (Didn't learn from SLGG)

2- Short HF who want people to divest from GME, the original idiosyncratic risk

3- Loopring itself that don't mind the extra attention, and can easily claim plausible deniability, and who anyway are in continental China so even if they went full on in the fraud they are basically untouchable and have been own a great amount of LRC so if they want to sell, well, they are all millionaires now anyway.",1640699405,hq9yvks

Posts by Loopring on LinkedIn reveal that GameStop’s soon-to-be-announced NFT marketplace will feature instant, gas-free transactions.

Prior to this, GMEdd.com had published digital breadcrumbs leading to that same point, detailing how Loopring has the technology that GameStop would require to bridge traditional e-commerce and blockchain and engineer the revolution of gaming.

You know the drill. Read those posts first, then come back. Actually, you’ve probably read them already, considering GMEdd.com crashed amid all the traffic and LRC is up 46% today. You’re welcome, Loopring. Sorry if we startled you.

NOBODY RIDES FOR FREE

In an October 13th, 2021 thread on Twitter, Damiana Amabile, a former Chewy executive turned GameStop Director of Product shared her frustration with completing her first purchase on NFT marketplace OpenSea. 

Amabile states that, “the process was not easy,” and that it was eye-opening considering how traditional e-commerce has embraced a one-click/tap checkout experience.



The first tweet in Amabile’s Twitter thread discusses gas fees.

The GameStop Director of Product’s first complaint about OpenSea was that the concept of “gas fees” is so foreign to anyone not in the space. She imagines this is a high drop off point in the conversion tunnel. 

“Gas fees” are the transaction fees that users pay on a blockchain protocol to have their transaction executed. The system works on a standard supply and demand mechanism. 

If there is more demand for transactions, users will be forced to pay more to have their transactions processed quickly and efficiently. Currently, there’s plenty of demand.

High gas fees can be regarded as one of Ethereum’s biggest inhabitants of growth, with little desire for users to complete trades that often cost more than what they’re worth.



High gas fees have plagued Ethereum for over a year.

In a CoinDesk Opinion story from October 14, 2020, former Amazon executive turned CEO of a blockchain education company Michael J. Garbade writes that High Ethereum gas prices make it impossible for ERC-20 projects to run any microtransaction payments on Ethereum, defeating the idea of using the Ethereum network for one of its principal use cases.

Garbade explores one potential solution: zkRollup technology, stating that the trustless protocol from zkSync was, at the time, the most efficient answer.



zkRollup technology has the potential to solve high gas fees on Ethereum’s network

While there are several companies that have built ETH Layer 2 protocols using zkRollup technology, Loopring has since emerged as one of the most advanced and capable of mass-adoption.

LOOPRING, WE’RE NOT DONE YET

Loopring states that one major advantage of being application specific is that the protocol can optimize Loopring’s L1 footprint to the extreme as opposed to other Layer 2s. 

This means Loopring L2 is much more scalable, faster + less expensive to use than other general purpose Ethereum L2s.

If you’re confused, Loopring’s Head of Community Byron Wiebe can frequently be found answering questions from LRC holders and curious GameStop investors alike on Loopring’s Discord server (to the best of his ability given the circumstances).



Byron answered some questions from ManBearOrca on October 26th.

When asked about delaying the launch until ETH2.0 is live, Byron goes on to state that Loopring’s technology is already capable of handling 4,000 transactions per second currently, “similar capacity to Mastercard daily transactions globally.”

Byron also states that Loopring’s free Layer2 Wallet will be launching simultaneously or prior to the NFT Marketplace, allowing for easy adoption amongst those who aren’t used to crypto.

“WE UH, WE FIXED THE GLITCH.”

In a LinkedIn post today, Loopring has added some commentary on their Q3 2021 Quarterly Update, which was published by Byron.

Loopring announced that they will be enabling NFT support, “allowing anyone to mint and trade NFTs instantly and gas-free.”



Loopring shared this post on LinkedIn on October 28th 2021.

Loopring goes on to state that this functionality is now the foundation of a new NFT Marketplace launching soon.

With Damiana Amabile’s major gripes with NFT transactions solved by Loopring, the gap between traditional e-commerce and blockchain could be bridged.

It’s now beyond a reasonable doubt that GameStop has found a partner for their venture into the future.

We just wouldn’t be so sure that Loopring is the only one.

I'm well aware of how exchanges work but that does very little to explain why you think the value of this entire project is completely tied up with 1 coin.",1635755815,hiv3aza
"What do I think will happen?

Of course, these are my thoughts and make sure you DYOR. I think Loopring will rise anyway. It’s all time high was over $2.40, and is currently sitting at $0.56. With GME and if the partnership is confirmed, I believe it could rocket to a top 10 cryptocurrency coin between $30-$50+ a coin or even higher, which is why I hold Loopring (LRC). I believe it’s going to rocket up in value, and if GME does partner with them, it’s going to moon hard! Loopring is also valuable as it deflationary. This means the total LRC supply decreases over time which can impact Loopring’s token price and market cap positively. With cryptocurrency, volatility is why people invest in it. When something moons, it goes to unbelievable levels - just look at Bitcoin and Ethereum.

For GME, I think having such a solid infrastructure shows growth, and will allow GME to establish themselves as a global leader in the NFT space. This should propel GME’s share price much higher. By diversifying into NFT's, with an incredible layer 2 protocol behind it, Gamestop will be able to benefit from its partnerships with Hasbro and Microsoft, allowing it to become dominant in the NFT space. With many game studios looking for a solid NFT marketplace to mint their NFT's, a successful Gamestop NFT marketplace would be the perfect place for them to do this, thus bringing in huge revenues for Gamestop.

I hope it helps clear things up a little better for everybody wondering why GME and Loopring could be huge news for both.",1635755475,hiv2yjg
"Best places to buy Loopring (LRC)

It is available to purchase on the following exchanges, just to name a few:

Loopring

Coinbase

Uniswap

Matcha

There are many more exchanges, but these are the most common exchanges. Loopring and Coinbase are the most recognised.

What are NFT’s?

NFT’s (which GME is aiming to roll out) are currently taking the digital art and collectibles world by storm. NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us tokenise things like art, collectibles, even real estate. They can only have one official owner at a time, and they're secured by the Ethereum blockchain – no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence.

NFT’s are currently selling for large amounts of money. For example, a collection of 10000 NFT’s ‘sold’ for $530 million.

Where does GME fit into all of this?

GME is creating a NFT marketplace. You can see this here: https://nft.gamestop.com/

If GameStop can establish themselves as owners of a leading global NFT marketplace, it will create an incredible new revenue stream for Gamestop, and hopefully this will reflect on the share price.

Web 3, Ethereum, Cryptocurrency and NFT’s are the future, and GME have placed 8 job adverts looking for workers with experience of “Ethereum, NFTs and blockchain-based gaming platforms.”",1635755460,hiv2y0a
"lol, my comment got deleted cuz it was too long, [but I see that OP didn't delete it](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qjv5gk/gme_and_loopring_lets_clear_this_up/hiugsnk/)

Original post:

Many of us have heard about the potential GME partnership with the cryptocurrency Loopring, but do not have any idea about why this could be a game changer for both GME and Loopring.

I have tried my best to provide a clearer breakdown to help anyone trying to understand why many of us are very excited by the news that GME maybe have partnered with Loopring.

What is Loopring?

Loopring is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling protocol that enables the building of decentralized exchanges, which rival centralized exchanges in terms of performance. It allows users to trade without the need for a custodian or intermediary. A decentralised exchange allows users to trade their assets (normally cryptocurrency) without having the need to fill out KYC regulation forms.

Loopring has a cryptocurrency token which goes by the symbol LRC. Loopring has currently an exchange built (https://app.loopring.info), an smart wallet to hold your cryptocurrencies in, and aims to become the leading user-facing financial services application in the world.

What’s Ethereum?

Ethereum is open access to digital money and data-friendly services for everyone – no matter your background or location. Its token is goes by the symbol ETH. Ethereum allows you to move money, or make agreements without directly having to go to someone else (No need for banks or payment providers). The middleman is taken out of the picture. It is decentralised – meaning it makes it nearly impossible to stop you from receiving or using services on Ethereum. All transactions are stored on an electronic ledger, allowing you to keep track of all your transactions. It is also the main network for NFT’s, which are taking the world by storm (see below for more information on NFT’s.)",1635755422,hiv2wnc
what's really gonna blow your mind is when [gamestop.app](https://gamestop.app) contains an LRC counterfactual wallet inside it that is connected to both computershare and loopring exchange,1635754868,hiv2cm8
"You know it’s a breath of fresh air that the mods are not blocking these LRC posts I myself posted my position on LRC but fully expected to get the post removed

"Sorry, you think the only currency Loopring accept payment in is their own coin?

And even if GameStop do pay LR in LRC that doesn't mean it will be the predominant currency across the platform or that the platform's value will be tied to the coins.

That's like saying Barcelona football club's value is tied to BNB's because BNB is the coin developed by an exchange that they're on.",1635754140,hiv1lyc
Agreed. I have a huge pile of GME but crypto trades over the weekend and im an addict so got a few $$$ of LRC in the bag.,1635753486,hiv0xq6

"I’m on Coinbase, but you can also buy LRC from Gemini from what I’ve seen.  
  
I honestly don’t trust Coinbase, so I’m planning on moving to Gemini, so I’d do a quick read on both of them to see which one you’re comfortable buying LRC with.  
  
Things To Note About Crypto:

-	There is a fee for every purchase and for every sell.  
-	You can trade 24/7.
-	Do not use Coinbase wallet once you get into wallets. Fees are too high. Me, once I decide to move to Gemini, I’m just going to sell off my LRC and transfer the money to my bank, then re-purchase LRC on Gemini. Cashing out seems to have less fees compared to transferring crypto to and from exchanges/wallets.

As for watchlists/alerts/charts, I use the app CoinMarketCap. You can view candles with it and set price alerts.",1635750976,hiuyb79

"It’s because the term ‘crytpocurrency’ is kind of misleading. Bitcoin entered the digital asset space as a cryptocurrency, but since Bitcoin’s inception, there are other digital assets that have come about that aren’t crypto’currency’ strictly speaking. 

‘Crypto’ original meant ‘Cryptography’ or ‘Cryptology’ - “The science of protecting information by transforming it into a secure format”.

That’s what made Bitcoin a Cryptocurrency in the first place. Not because it was digital - but because it was secure. Somehow, Crypto became a shorthand for digital assets, when that’s not necessarily correct.

There’s huge overlap, because pretty much all digital assets utilise some form of Cryptography, so if you call a digital asset a Cryptographic digital asset - you wouldn’t exactly be wrong. That doesn’t automatically make it a currency though. But it’s not the fact that it’s digital that makes it cryptographic. That’s just sort of a standard that is required for digital assets to be secure. 

Digital assets include cryptocurrencies, as well as utility tokens, exchange tokens and security tokens. But a lot of the time people will refer to all of them as ‘crypto’ or ‘cryptocurrency’ together - which is just wrong technically speaking. Again, they very often do use cryptography, but that doesn’t make them currency.

I can see why you may think LRC tokens are like buying a ‘share’ of the platform, but whilst it’s not exactly false, it’s not exactly true either. let me clarify: 

LRC is a stakable token on the Ethereum network, which you buy with Ether - the cryptocurrency of that network. What that means is this: 

&gt; ""LRC is used as a stakable token. It can be staked by anyone to earn part of the protocol fees on the network, and is also staked by DEXs for extra economic security guarantees.""

&gt; The LRC token will be used for fee's and governance. ""Smart contract updates will, in part, be governed by token holders to ensure continuity and safety, and to attenuate the risks of siphoned liquidity through incompatibility.""
From Bankless (2020 Q3 report): ""A portion of trading fees are distributed to LRC holders.""

Furthermore:

&gt; At its most basic level, the staking process boils down to an interested party posting a ‘bond’ (stake) to become a network validator,  which in turn makes that party eligible for staking rewards

So in essence, the LRC token is something that allows transaction to occur on the exchange. They are a token that you stake - which enables the platfrom to validate transactions and ensure security. You are then rewarded with more tokens for fulfilling this duty via the fees that users pay when they make transactions on that platform. 

Those stakable tokens become more valuable when there is increasing transaction volume on the platform and when there is a higher demand for people to become stakers of that platform. 

When transaction volumes are increasing, so are protocol fees. So stakers get paid more when the platform attracts users by offering a good service. You earn more from the tokens you stake when the platform attracts users. So you are investing in the platform ability to attract more and more users to use its services more and more frequently. 

Also, If people begin to find staking lucrative, then they will purchase more tokens to stake - this increases the demand for those tokens, and the tokens you already have increase in value. In this case, you’re essentially investing in the platform’s ability to attract investors that want to buy tokens in order to stake them for a return on said tokens - but both scenarios kind of go hand in hand. 

The more people that use the platform and the more people that wish to purchase LRC tokens to stake on the platform, the higher the price of the LRC tokens become. 

Unfortunately I’m not well-versed on the tax laws surrounding all of the different digital assets, and i’m sure they differ between country and region, so I can’t answer that last part for you unfortunately. But I would be massively surprised if any government has not yet begun taxing them. I think you get taxed when you convert something like ETH or BTC into fiat currency - but I could be wrong.",1635723066,hitobhd

Again, I'm not telling anyone how to use their money. I'm making the simple observation that LRC is **not** GME, and LoopRing the company is different from LRC the crypt0. It's okay to discuss LoopRing, but pushing crypt0 here has never been the way.",1635803976,hixqten

People should keep this in mind when investing into any crypto.

I guess right now people would likely be early adopters in LRC and could make some money, when it hypes. But the real value will always be in the business actually making money with the technology, which also happens to be a company with infinity squeeze potential.

"basically you need a good amount of two different coins (usually ETH + another coin) to add them to the ""Automated Market Maker (AMM) Liquidity Pool"". YOU become the market maker, except really you're just supplying the coins so a computer can do it for you!

In total I used around $1.2k USD to do it, but basically I spent a bunch of gas to move my Ethereum to a Loopring wallet, then bought the Loopring coin (LRC) from Coinbase and transferred that over to Loopring as well. you can't buy LRC directly from Loopring using USD, but I believe it may be possible to just do a large, one-time transfer of a bunch of ETH to a Loopring L2 wallet, then just trade ETH for LRC on the Loopring exchange so there's no gas fees.

anyway there's pairs for LRC/USDC and other stables as well, which the USDC one is giving out 64% APR right now, so that's a great one to get in on. there was one pair this morning that was giving like 30,000% APR or something insane like that lol but those percentages change based on coin availability, so it gives higher rewards for staking pairs with less ""liquid"" in the ""pools"".

once you have enough of the two tokens you'd like to stake, you can find the ""utilize"" tab and deposit your tokens into a pool to start earning risk free!

as for the catch? there is none. Loopring wants people to be able to trade tokens on their platform, but they need tokens available for people who want to trade. so,  they incentivize people to give them tokens by charging a fee for swaps of those tokens and giving (I think 80% of) that fee directly to the ""liquidity partners"" (me, for ETH/LRC swaps!) so the money comes from users of the platform who are willing to pay a very small fee for instant swaps with the full security of the Ethereum Blockchain but without burning the planet and starving poor gamers of their insanely overpriced graphic cards! everyone wins when you cut out citadel!",1635841690,hizm3pw
"I want to make it clear I'm talking about the constant barrage of LRC ( the coin) posts with charts showing how much it has pumped that's what I don't like. I want to see posts about Loopring the company and what it is doing, there's a big difference.",1635841495,hizlwc3
"For sure. And not even saying OP was in bad faith here, I think the concern is still valid, but the approach I disagreed with.  
Superstonk as a whole has found a pretty good rhythm when it comes to ""off-topic but still topic adjacent"" things. We do address RRP and market health indicators like Futures, inflation and unemployment because they have been invaluable to some of the core DD thesis here. So to emphasize I don't think we should be removing those things from the discussion because the further we've dug the more we realized how many factors were at play, and that this goes far beyond what started as a simple short squeeze.  
The sub has grown alongside our wrinkles. We've always managed to keep the focus on the company, the stock, and Moass. Occasional spikes in hype or news can get things a little imbalanced –which I do think is happening with LRC and Loopring atm– but we always either self regulate back to normal or eventually find a solution that protects the sub from attack without overly restricting things.  
Caution is important, shutting down shills is a given. I'm in support of Mods establishing general guidelines on this in particular so there's a clear understanding in the sub, as it does have that vibe of going full sub drama otherwise.  
Either way I think we will find the right way to dig into Loopring and LRC like we have for so many other things that have become intertwined with GME, but that only will happen if we continue to keep discussion as open as we can within the context and overall focus of the sub.",1635840483,hizkth2

"Ok. I have coinbase app now. I bought LRC. It shows a lrc wallet on the coinbase app. 

However, I go to Loopring website and it asks to download loopring app, which I did. And in that app it asks to create wallet, and cost  around $185. Is this legit? I want to make sure I’m not being ripped off. I just wasn’t aware of the cost of creating a wallet. And would that mean the ‘LRC wallet’ shown in the coinbase app is not really a wallet?

"Loopring/LRC and GME are in partnership to build GME's NFT platform. There is plenty of evidence that supports this, all that's missing is an official announcement. If GME and LRC successfully execute this NFT strategy then GME becomes a more valuable company thereby placing additional pressure on SHFs/Citadel. So yes, LRC is relevant to the MOASS theory.

"I responded down further, bit for visibilities sake I'll leave my thoughts below too, but to sum it up- I think my biggest issue here is lack of consistency. If we are shutting down something that is directly related to GS then we better be shutting down everything else we discuss on the overall market too. Otherwise it's strange and hypocritical to be singling this out. 

&gt;Pumping and discussing are two different things. We point to market shifts during the day with SPY, Bank stocks and discuss futures don't we?  There's talk about Evergrande all the time here because it impacts the overall market and by extension MOASS. So why is noting that the price of something that actually has direct ties to GS suddenly bad?  

I agree that this isn't the place to pump it, and obviously anyone trying to say they should sell GME for LRC needs to be shut down, but keeping an eye on the correlation between price runs isn't. Most comments today were about the price and hype for the simultaneous runups as we go into this week speculating on an announcement between the two for NFTs. If Loopring had a stock ticker I doubt people would be as quick to cry shill for just pointing out price changes. But just because it's crypt-o it's been degraded to pumping a random shitcoin? If you view something Loopring has produced that poorly then why be excited for them to partner with GS?  

 You assert it was pumping because of discussion here specifically, I personally think if anything it was the other way around. The real run up didn't start until the partnership leaked from GitHub. Every single article I saw about LRC climbing had GameStop in the title. It was good news for both of them, but LRC got a chance to pop first because of not having market hour restrictions. I firmly believe that at least a portion of our run today was directly caused by that leak and LRC's subsequent run pushing GS in the headlines.

I'm not saying we shouldn't have at least some guidelines here to avoid full forum sliding and ensure focus is kept on GME, but outright calling to shut down any mention of the coin removes a valuable source of info that can be applied to future DD and other speculations on Loopring as a company as the partnership progresses.  

We all know that the way to MOASS is to Buy, Hodl, and DRS. Nothing has changed, no one is going to sell their position just to hopefully catch a pump. If they did they were never a diamond handed ape anyway.",1635833723,hizd55c

I'm not saying we shouldn't have at least some guidelines here to avoid full forum sliding and ensure focus is kept on GME, but outright calling to shut down any mention of the coin removes a valuable source of info that can be applied to future DD and other speculations on Loopring as a company as the partnership progresses.

Talking about their relevance should be about what they may have in terms of the upcoming announcement, and what GS intends to do with the rumored association.  

The understanding about what the difference between NFT and LRC will happen with time and education, but if we start being all reactionary and hostile about it now, it just leads to this education taking longer....just like what happened with DRS where we weren't receptive, and kind of hostile about the idea until we got to a point where we didn't even discuss it, and most people forgot about it despite being told directly it's a good thing to do by experts.",1635830714,hiz9aet

"Cryptic tweets are nothing new to GameStop investors, but Chinese is. What is the Loopring CEO saying on Twitter?

Loopring’s LRC Ethereum token has climbed over 120% in only days as speculation rises that GameStop’s NFT marketplace is launching soon.

On Wednesday, October 27th, GMEdd published source code from Loopring’s public GitHub repository that confirmed the highly-speculated partnership amongst the ambitious digital pioneers.
The Swordsman (劍客)

While traders attempt to position themselves accordingly, Loopring’s CEO has shared a classic chinese poem on Twitter.

Loopring CEO Daniel Wang tweeted this at 9:37 PM EST on November 1st.

The text originates from Jia Dao’s classic Chinese poem, The Swordsman. 

    十年磨一剑

    霜刃未曾试

    今日把示君

    谁有不平事

Jia Dao was a Chinese Buddhist monk and poet active during the Tang dynasty.

According to Dr. James J.Y. Liu, a professor of Chinese and comparative literature, Jia’s poem “The Swordsman” (劍客) to sums up the spirit of knight errantry in four lines.

Here is a translation, courtesy of Andrew W.F. Wong.
For ten long years, a sword I whetted,  
Its frosty blade, as yet, untried.
Today, I hold it unsheathed before you;
Of you, to whom was justice denied?
What does it mean?

The poem can be understood as an analogy of a man, the poet, after studying hard (whetting his sword) for ten years, is now ready to take the imperial examinations (show his sword/swordsmanship to represent scholarship and abilities), pledging that he, as an official (the “swordsman”, as in the title), will right all injustices.  

One explanation is that Wang considers himself the swordsman, and, after years of hard work, he is now ready to present his abilities, GameStop NFT, to the world.

Full disclosure I'm xxxx shareholder in GME and we've been in since $26. I hope the loopring link is real. I really do. I'm just hesitant to jump in to the hype at this point because people are fucked up and will take advantage of a group like this to make money.",1635825370,hiz15zz

"Well maybe we should ask the OP in the screenshot what he meant? brb ..... 

Oh hai there. So my comment was directed entirely at the ""This is a GME sub only ..... don't talk about coins"" comment I replied to. I agree with you, anyone pumping coins or trying to get someone to buy coins is sus and we don't give financial advice here. But Loopring is looking like a GME partner now (unofficially), and if they are becoming successful then I  think we should be allowed to talk about it. We talk about coin pumps and SPY and VIX and god knows how many other tickers all the time, when it's convenient. What I'm saying is that it's okay to talk about Loopring and what they are doing. If someone wants to update on their price increase, isn't that a good thing? We like little brother. 

Also I don't think we have to worry about people YOLO'ing into LRC. That seems like the main fear here from what I see. ""We buy/hodl GME and nothing else/People will spend their money on a distraction"" and I get it, but come on, that's not reality. I have side quests that collect tendies that I put right back into my main stonks. And that's okay too, so have no fear about me pumping them in here. Sometimes we seem like the jealous boyfriend you know? Anyways all good people. Good thread, good discussion. May the Schwartz Be With You.

2) An exchange owner needs to stake LRC for economic security &amp; reputation.
3) LRC can be staked to lower the protocol fees on a specific exchange by an exchange owner, market makers and high-frequency traders.

It would be their DEX (decentralized exchange) that uses ""order rings"" and ""ring miners"" to process their transactions and facilitate trades and the ZK rollups to add scalability without sacrificing the underlying blockchain's security.

If dickheads like you didn't downvote posts trying to link the bridge between LRC and GameStop, more people would be making BANK right now off LRC. A lot of people in the GS community don't even know what LRC was until I tried explaining it to some. Your mindset makes you no different from the Peter Schiff gold mongers denying the progress of BitcOin. Whether you want to acknowledge this for truth or not I don't care, but the truth is if you weren't so narrow minded about this sub and topics being discussed, a lot of people in this sub would have thrown $1,000 on dogmeme tokens 6 months ago and become legit billionaires.

Whoever’s is about to start with it make sure to read into the basics of how to use a crypt00 wallet generally and the specific L1/L2 ETH stuff. The wallet itself has no help/ tips section. Don’t end up misplacing your assets or paying L1 fees…

Plus the wallets costs you 186.x LRC to get started with it, nowhere this is mentioned before using it. Full transparency is different IMO..

Not saying it’s bad, but it’s not newbie friendly.",1635859401,hj0b6bz

Worst case GME holds the line and I dump the LRC rip into GME. 

The fact that my graphics card is essentially printing money blows my freakin mind some days 😂",1635858660,hj09njp
"First and foremost GME and DRS is the way. The reason LRC is pumping is apes and other people buying in on the leak and  upcoming announcement. The token has value because when trading and minting NFTs on looprings platform it will charge a fee this fee will be charged in LRC so once the platform is fully ready people will need to own LRC to utilize the platform therefore making the tokens valuable. 
Note this does NOT mean apes would need to own any LRC to claim a NFT dividend if this was distributed on the Loopring/GameStop platform. Also even though it's open source if someone copied the code they would not have the same items on the platform so would not have the same value. Once again the money made from MOASS will be far more then any gains made from buying and owning LRC. 
I have nothing against apes buying and  owning LRC however the real play is and always will be GME. 
Buy GME, DRS and hold. None of this is financial advise. 🚀🚀🚀",1635858583,hj09hvc
"The fomo into LRC and out of the coins pumped by SHFs could be catastrophic for them. So there’s that. But I totally get your point otherwise.

It’s just a hard argument because I found that this is something I would at least want to know about otherwise and feel other apes will to. I wouldn’t know about it without this sub though. Make sense?",1635858534,hj09edk
"But the whole point of loopring and why its exciting is its ability to massively shrink the sorts of transaction fees you see with the likes of ETH, meaning that you can use it much easier on things like low cost NFTs or in-game microtransations. The tech of LRC is precisely why GME are collaborating with that particular defi network. Without a coin its a whitepaper.",1635858382,hj093ai
Loopring is relevant to GME fundamentals. The price of LRC isn't.,1635858350,hj090z7
"The NFTs are going to be based on ETH, but I don't think talking about ETH's gains or losses would be appropriate here. That seems like something that should be discussed on the ETH or cc sub.

Or have I missed some DD on LRC that links LRCs value to GMEs?",1635858339,hj09043

"LoopRing is related to GME because they are rumored/leaked to be working on an NFT marketplace for GME. LoopRing *coin* I would argue isn't related to GME. I'm not going to tell you where to use your money, but speaking only for myself, I would prefer any talk about LoopRing be related to it's NFT work that can be tied back to GME. I'd rather not hear about how much LRC has gained, or how much someone has bought. It's not like buying LRC, or how much it has gained is going to have a tangible effect on GME rising, or accelerate an announcement.",1635857530,hj07fk5

Yes. You still have to set the wallet up which costs lrc. Then you have to transfer the lrc to the l1 portion of the wallet which costs eth. Then you have to move it from l1 to l2. Which costs Eth.

I think Pokemon will be a late adopter of NFT. Pokemon honestly doesn't innovate much imo. They have a formula that works and they are going to stick to that and milk that cash cow. I mean, just look at Pokemon Arceus.

"Good Morning.

I have had a chance to review the facts presented and have come to the following conclusion:

While it is very likely that the original source of the confirmation was unintended (Oct. 26th fork push), there are ways to modify history on \`git\` or to make problematic repositories closed (via privatizing them) to the public eye and pulls. If this information **really wasn't** supposed to get out, it would not have in this manner. This tells me two things:

Firstly, that the leak isn't really that big of a deal. Presume that the leak was a big deal: what actions would have reasonably followed? Did any of them happen? No. The entailment does not hold.

Secondly, it does confirm that Loopring is working with GameStop directly to go from POC to Implemented. There is not another explanation that makes sense as to why the gamestopNft&lt;...&gt; stuff would intrude onto the Loopring source code given that LRC is supposed to be an abstract system. From this, it also follows that the information about the collaboration is not supposed to be secret. How do we know this? Go back to the ""firstly"" point. The actions that could have been taken to disrupt public visibility were not taken; additionally, there is no lawsuit from GS -&gt; Loopring that we have been able to find which points to a lack of material breach of contract RE: secrecy.

*I still do not see this information as a smoking gun, but I do see it as an opportunity.*

If it turns out that this is the vehicle for an NFT dividend, then it will be the smoking gun... but in order for a gun to smoke it has to take a shot. Like a shot of whisky (that, mind you, takes money to buy).

Fluff aside, this still reads to me like two companies trying to work out an integration where one developer copied another company's code into their source to act as a reference so they don't have to jump between screens.  I still personally believe this is overhyped.",1637337865,hl9o4ba

There isn't a mainstream NFT that holds any value yet as all it has been so far is just digital artists and also scam artists taking advantage of the space. I am just as sad as everyone else that this is the current face of NFTs, but without evidence linking these attempts this post makes us look just as crazy as those buying pixel NFTs.

"Changlog is a log of what code changes have been done

So, Loopring Github (their code repository) is basically saying that they added the following functions in V2.6


A) NFT withdraw from Layer 2 (Loopring) to Layer 1 (Ethereum)

this would be functionality to move from GME/LRC Layer 2 NFT Platform to Ethereum

B) NFT Deposit L1 -&gt; L2 

To deposit a NFT from Ethereum (Layer 1) to Layer 2 (GME/LRC NFT Platform)

NFT approvedALL for Exchange -&gt; not sure exactly what this means. It could be approved for 'GME' Exchange' or just approved for 'exchange' between Layers

***********************

C) NFT Transfer L 2 -&gt; L2

This is a transfer of NFTs between two accounts on Layer 2 i.e. GME/LTC NFT Platform

*************
Layer 1 Transfer would be $20 to $150 or more. So very expensive on Ethereum

By doing Layer 1 (Ethereum) to Layer 2 (GME/LRC)

and then doing Layer 2 -&gt; Layer 2, it can be done for pennies
**************

D) NFT Mint L2 -&gt; this is minting a NFT (creating a NFT) on Layer 2 (GME/LRC)

again, doing this on Layer 1 Ethereum is super expensive - $20 to $150. On Layer 2 it can be very, very cheap or very cheap

******************

E) NFT META -&gt; ha ha ha ha ha

This is some NFT Metasphere/NFT Metaverse stuff or something

**********************

F) NFT Action Check History L2

Not sure. Perhaps some check of everything that has been done to the NFT/with the NFT

****************************

This is VERY BIG functionality. The meat and bones of what user use case scenarios would be

i.e.

what do users do with NFTs?

Mint them

sell them

buy the,

this covers most of the stuff user does

******************************

Is it the final update before launch? Not sure

Conversely, could GameStop introduce a similar common exchange to simplify the transition between creators and existing crypto networks; something that handles diversified assets and communicates with existing networks to alleviate the need for users to understand the underlying systems; a SimplifiedEX?

""hey guys, typescript dev here! so this is their API for people like me to use to build a dApp that can interact with their L2 protocols. now that we have NFT capabilities, I could make a game! or a social media app.. or some kind of financial tool.. and when it's published, it'll only use Loopring's protocols to handle everything, so no gas fees! When they update the SDK like this, it means they've updated their end already to be ready to accept these calls from the SDK. so yeah. this is fantastic news. Also very good chance that GameStop already knew about these methods and may be working with their own version of the SDK or that they just knew about these changes for a while.

the language they're using to write this is Typescript, which is a way to write better JavaScript, which plays around with Python and Java as the most used languages in the world. This makes creating custom dApps much more accessible to the public, which is really really big news. now you don't need to know Solidity to make something that uses the Ethereum Blockchain.

pretty fuckin dope if you ask me.

edit: spelling

edit: hijacking my own post to say that I would be so nervous if I knew the entire GME/LRC community was ~~nit-picking~~ reviewing my merge commits 😅😅😂😂😂

one more edit: also she's doing this on Sunday night. I don't know what work culture is like in Hong Kong, but if it's anything like the US then the only time you'd be working on a weekend is if you have a deadline, or you just like what you do and actually enjoy working on the project.

Claims that some are pushing options when it's mostly been people making posts about how options have impacted the stock previously and some general notes on how options work. I haven't seen anyone pushing specific option dates/strikes or saying we need to get more people using options.

I think people need to accept that just because they don't understand something or it doesn't conform to their beliefs of the situation is not grounds to call others shills or express malcontent at ideas. 

Personally, I think this sub (and other GME subs) does its own forum sliding by people not actually taking the time to fully understand everything and then just posting opinions based on half truths.

"Honestly because people assume shit too fast. I’ve bought LRC literally because of  Superstonk. Pump and dump? Nah, I honestly have my crypto in Coinbase and wanted to ask which was the best app for purchase, and I have been holding my breath as I learn more shit about following people on twitter and figuring out what developers are working with what companies to make what platforms. It’s all speculation and fun for me, but honestly I’m new to crypto. I’ve been reading Superstonk for AGES. I actually wanna reread atobitt’s DD, as well as a few others. People can think I’m trying to pump and dump all they want, they can fuck right off. I’ve held my shares, I’ve honestly yet to DRS them because of anxiety.

"yes, that is true

At the same time

at some point you just have to take all the data and make a calculated bet

LRC is going to spike after the announcement. Gives you more money to buy GME as GMe share price is heavily manipulated and will not grow as fast as LRC",1637040693,hktj5i6
"Yeah. Of course that’s a risk. But you could also buy LEAPs, there are tons of strategies.  
But let’s say over the next two months there’s the possibility of a LRC/NFT announcement, forced by in due to another cycle ending. Good earnings and something more than a 7 min earning call.  
I mean if you don’t think this is going to go up then why invest in it? And why not make as much money as possible while doing as much damage to the MMs as possible?",1637039865,hkthqkg
"These kinds of posts always make me laugh because I rarely see anything they’re claiming is being pushed. Whether  it’s complaining about a bunch of other people posting “big LRC gains”, or complaining others are encouraging options plays - I live in new and read probably 95% of all posts on this sub, and barely ever see what they’re complaining about happening actually happening

Interestingly, they ***almost always*** have one or two lines that send the complete opposite message than what they’re complaining about. In this one, it’s “options are a way to get big gains”. OP’s who do this also almost always close with a reminder of how retarded or smooth brained they are (and as a bonus throw in how they’re high or drunk), and end with a “Hedgies are fuk”, “Ken lied”, or “buy hodl DRS”

It’s like a reverse psychology formula I see over and over and over",1637037213,hktczvj

"Expectations for LRC?

I think it’s going to jump (currently around $3, might hit $6? 10?) after GameStop makes their announcement. 

That high might not last long but if the NFT marketplace is successful and other companies adopt Loopring for various purposes it should keep climbing. 

I have no idea what it could get to but I’m already kicking myself for not buying some LRC back when the partnership rumors first started.",1637016691,hks3ju2
here I was thinking that LRC meant LoopRingCoin,1637016462,hks2zok
👍 This and the lrc bullshit. Mods forgot to do their job.,1636498176,hjzv8gb
My LRC gains in a week are nothing to scoff at! I think the partnership is all but announced.,1636498111,hjzv2vk
I'm sick and tired of these LRC shills,1636497749,hjzu7n0
I’m long LRC for this exact reason,1636497630,hjztxde
"So, just theorizing a little bit. If GameStop and Loopring collaborations are true, then GameStop would certainly need to have some LRC on their balance sheet in order to operate the marketplace which would be revealed on December 6th when they present their latest quarter, correct?

Just a possibility",1636497531,hjztosy
The reason I think it’s not strange to buy into loopring is because of the information we have early on because we are balls deep into GME for 10 months. I don’t say buy popcorn…why would you…..but we all know loopring in the cryptouniverse is going to give us good gains…we know because we are in GME. When the whole public gets to know it we are already in…..don’t we deserve it after 10 months holding seeing all kind of tickers explode. I believe in GME and therefore also in LRC.,1636497529,hjztomn
I never said don’t buy LRC. Im holding LRC myself it’s free money. What I said was the reason LRC is running and GME is not is because crime. Aka it’s easier for the hedge funds and Market Makers to manipulate the price of GameStop down than it is for them to manipulate a crypto.,1636497201,hjzswba
"for real. i basically just converted my small amount of a bunch of random cryptos, about $400, into LRC when i found out about the GME connection and now its like 3k. Gonna ride it out a bit and get some more shares with it later.",1636496989,hjzsdtr
The user you're responding to has been on here all day creating division among anyone who dares mention LRC. Don't mind them. Probably a paid shill,1636496590,hjzrez3
"Me too. As I have to wait for my verification code to be able to buy through CS instead of etoro. I still wanted to buy something and the one and only other option was LRC. So I have some xxx of LRC side by side with my xxx gme on etoro. And currently the one fresh DRS'd share on CS from IBKR. 

In 2 weeks bonus payment and salary and guess what All im gme for the 100th time",1636495532,hjzours
"I agree. I've seen the confirmation bias go bad other ways. 

If anyone was involved with SPACs, there were theories and ""breadcrumbs"" and rarely were they right.

The biggest piece of evidence to me is that Matt Finestone has a Loopring connection, but that still doesn't hold up under scrutiny. Just because he worked somewhere and also said he's leaving for a big opportunity doesn't mean they are at all connected anymore.

No single piece of evidence is strong enough to confirm it for me, and all these little ""breadcrumbs"" make it seem super likely, but I've been burned before.

Hey, remember NFTcon or whatever lol!

Loopring has no obligation to deny the GME theories, and they LOVE the attention they are getting from us. So they have no motive to denounce it.

There's no doubt GameStop is getting into NFTs and all that based on their hirings, but I'm not 100% convinced Loopring is us and won't be until it's announced.

For all I know, they are doing it to pump up LRC and they just made millions and could care less about us and their partner is some company we've barely heard of but they think is ""premiere""",1636495385,hjzohrj
"I guess the buying and holding LRC, but I might be wrong 🤷",1636495352,hjzoesw
I converted some of my other cryptos to LRC and I’m up 600% madness. Let’s fucking go!!,1636495039,hjznnb5
"Wow, surprised he didn't post LRC gains

2nd shift indeed",1636494925,hjznd73
"Yes, how could I forget! Well first of all, it's well known GME is working on an NFT marketplace. But it was the Director of Product, Damiana Amabile, that tweeted about complicated process and high fees associated with purchasing an NFT on Open Sea. Here is more [info](https://gmedd.com/blockchain/gamestops-nft-marketplace-will-feature-gas-free-instant-transactions/).

There aren't a ton of solutions for low-fee NFTs, but zk rollups tech used by Loopring achieves just that.

So far GameStop has been relatively quiet about their developments as Ryan Cohen admitted they would do at the AGM, so it's not shocking we don't have too many winks going GME to LRC.",1636494922,hjzncwq
"Might get me some GME too actually, but i have to say, at least in the short-mid term I can see LRC getting higher than GME percentage wise. Still barely has a 3b market cap and can easily 10x during the next couple months",1636494281,hjzlra6
Right? We can post shit like this but not about LRC which is directly related to GME. Lol,1636493886,hjzks5p
"TY for the well written post. You reinforced what I thought I knew about this possible partnership. 

I hold GME and a modest amount of LRC. I have been following the GME NFT breadcrumbs like you and others. I agree that there is more than likely a partnership between LR and GS in the works. 

But there is one little detail that is preventing me from going in deeper on LRC. I’ve seen the Loopring leaks and winks toward GameStop. I have not seen any reciprocal acknowledgement from GS toward LR. 

Aside from GS hiring a former employee of LR, is there any recent connection or wink or clue from *GameStop* suggesting a partnership with Loopring?",1636493843,hjzkoc4
aLl MoNeY iN lRc  MuSt hOdL,1636493264,hjzj7qf
"If by research you mean seen it mentioned on Superstonk and thought 'fuck it, bitcoin is boring anyway' and switched it all for LRC, then SAME!",1636492765,hjzhyqr
"I have almost auto-downvoted you because the beginning reads *exactly* as if you're gonna ask shit how to buy LRC 😂

Sorry fren, have an award",1636492734,hjzhvzf
"Hahaha wrong again. You’re bad at this. The only thing I hold now is GME and a small bit of LRC. February ape so none of this hype does anything for me in either direction. Just don’t like reading posts like yours. You should quit with the nonsense comments, friend.",1636492630,hjzhmnk
"So alright, on this you'd be hard-pressed NOT to find citadel somewhere... They're a behemoth. This is one of those things where if you wanna dance while the music is still playing, you'll have to rub elbows with some seedy folks. Citadel is not a monolith, and they have their operations ALL OVER THE MARKET so yeah, if people threw a couple hundred bucks at LRC, there's a chance Citadel benefits (microscopically). That's sorta the point here. Beat them at THEIR GAME, and then never play ever again.",1636492566,hjzhgwl
"I believe the return on investment on GME, if you believe in the MOASS thesis, is superior to LoopRing right now.

But bet I'll buy some LRC a bit later. 

It's deflationary, so likely to be a good investment regardless.",1636492402,hjzh269
So is everyone buying into LRC using Coinbase or some other exchange? I ask because Citadel is a whale according to this article from 2 months ago: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/08/17/goldman-citadel-securities-even-tennessees-treasury-among-coinbase-coin-whales/,1636492306,hjzgto5
"1. How does their token relate to what they're accomplishing through L2? Their website explains it but definitely not ELIA level.
2. Is LRC something you've invested in?
3. What is this technology attempting to replace? CC Fees?",1636492259,hjzgpck
If we get the announcement then LRC hits $10 easy imo and I'm optimistic about $20 in that case.,1636491984,hjzg0f9
LRC,1636491765,hjzfg5c
Has anyone opened a L2 wallet on looprings website yet? I’d love to send some there just to see what’s goin on but it costs me 83% of my LRC in gas just to send from coinbase.,1636491597,hjzf0kw
No that’s shilling LRC,1636491589,hjzezvb
"Yeah what a little bitch (Charles Payne pun intended)

The tabs are cool as fuck. Except shib. Sorry bout that just hate it due to the fact MSM pumped it when it came out. Respect for the LRC tho 🚀🚀🚀",1636491517,hjzet62
"Very cool. I think his tweet is a nod to LRC/GME bridging the gap between traditional finance and tokenization of finance, specifically stocks. HOLD=stock, HODL=crypto, GME is the ticker and not company name. And the DTCC announcement posted earlier only adds fuel to that theory.",1636491286,hjze7yk
LRC gains have been preparing me for what parabolic growth will look like,1636491145,hjzdv5i
"This is well thought out and constructed. Thank you, ape. I agree with most of what you speculate is next, but I think GameStop isn't stopping at just gaming NFTs - I think they're gonna make the largest NFT market and open it to all creators and anyone that wants to buy/sell any type of NFT. LRC fits the bill because it streamlines NFT creation, and I think RC was giving a nod about this with the HOLD/HODL tweet... if not something even bigger, to bridge the gap between crypto tokens and stocks, which may be why he referred to the GameStop ticker in that same tweet, and not the company by name.

Either way I'm buckled up for both GME and LRC to launch.",1636491095,hjzdqek
So the partnership between LRC and gamestop is basically the same as the partnership between myself and LRC. Because you and I can mint an nft there and pay the same. Then take it off the loopring exchange and have it staked by another defi coin.,1636490724,hjzcss4
"I do when its not spam

I acknowledge nuanced discussion and engage with it

I've commented positively on someone mentioning LRC

Go look",1636490490,hjzc7d2
"2 more shares in the bag thanks to insane LRC gains. I know it’s gauche but hey they’re our partner and I literally pulled these shares out of the air, on to DRS as soon as they settle",1636490379,hjzbx8d
"That's bc there aren't Microsoft comments.

There are new people on this sub talking about LRC though and calling everyone shills though

I'll keep champining GME

You championing other stuff and keep calling everyone shills",1636490138,hjzbbbj
"I look at it this way - no one is gonna get rich from LRC (unless you throw thousands in).  And no, investing in LRC is not going to assist the MOASS in any way.  But, if you've got some pocket change, why not jump on the train and enjoy the scenery?  I had a couple bucks (literally a couple) of BTC and transferred it into LRC.  I didn't actually spend $ that I could have put towards GME.  I think a lot of people are like me.  It can be a distraction only if you allow it.  But if you're realistic and are in it just for the experience, then it's really no big deal.  imho",1636490004,hjzaz8e
"Essentially yeah, converting whatever coin the lesson is on into LRC. I’m really surprised how easy it is. If everyone did it the cumulative purchase would be wild.",1636489948,hjzau4u
"&gt;Hype Microsoft if that's your logic 

I don't see you out here hating on Microsoft comments. 

&gt;""It basically is tho""

&gt;Which means its not

But it is

&gt;You're not a champion for GME, but LRC

Been holding for almost a year, but sure thing shill boy",1636489919,hjzargt
"Hype Microsoft if that's your logic 

It's partnered with GME at an official capacity.

""It basically is tho""

Which means its not

You're not a champion for GME, but LRC

We call that a shill round these parts

Shill on fella",1636489849,hjzal8b
"Are you just doing the learn and earns, selling the associated crypto and buying lrc?",1636489837,hjzak4z
"100% agreed.

It's fine if you're bullish on Loopring for its own merit, everyone here is an individual and can make their own decisions.

That said, it is ill-informed and poor judgement to assume LRC will go insane because of the MOASS directly.

The two might be correlated, but there is no direct causation as of now.",1636489671,hjza54x
"&gt;And every post about LRC isn't thoughtful analysis

Hype is still great. 

&gt;And hype for LRC isn't tantamount to hype for GME

It basically is tho. 

&gt;Do you now understand the downvotes you've accrued?

Sure I've always understood that there are paid shills like you around. What about it?",1636489666,hjza4qu

LRC staking is used for loopring protocol, which is different from LRC. because LRP can also work with other defi protocols like apollo, allowing for arbitrage across defi exchanges. 

They get 80% of transaction fees from l2 on the exchange, which are stupid low already. Buying LRC does not assist gamestop though. 

Either way, you can buy the nfts with LRC on l2. The actual nfts will probably get more monetary traction than the staking fee.",1636489153,hjz8udy

So why are so many people hesitant to believe these leaks about LRC? They seem legit from every angle. They haven't been disproven despite being around for months. It seems like just more awesome shit some of us have uncovered and/or discovered.

It's no 60 million dollars or whatever insane number GME may go to (no targets only up), but LRC looks to launch as well with our beloved GME.

So all that said, why not get even just a little bit, just in case it does partner like it seems like it will, and make that much more money to put toward GME tickets or a lambo or banana or whatever you want?

Why pass up on an opportunity to make that much more money? We don't know when moass will happen. I'm gonna keep stacking my stock portfolio AND my LRC, so no matter what happens or when it happens, I should be coming out on top.

Any thoughts on that?",1636422263,hjvquxn

"If you subscribe to this way of thinking, in the short term, especially with legitimately great fundamental announcements and *possible* dream team reveal LRC has massive potential. The buy in price, while much higher than it was, would still give you major bang for your buck. The CF wallet still needs to come out, the marketplace still needs to come out, and FOMO is starting to hit it hard. All that to say it might be a great play to jump on if only to cash out and buy more GME before liftoff! If not, hey the gme you already own will hedge the fuck out of anything anyways.

I literally longed it on binance futures the second I saw the leaks and it's the top gaining crypto by far.",1636405355,hjunoks
Horseshit.  The free LRC was 3 coins.  Even if you did it a couple weeks ago you are up about 3 dollars.,1636405293,hjunj3b
"
Loopring (LRC) mooning through exposure and association with GME once again provides support for our thesis -- if being GME-adjacent brings this kind of exposure and hype, are we trading at fair price?

Nah. We're being fed an army of synthetic shares deepening the hole the shorts are in. Hodl, fam.",1636405190,hjun9mw
Gamestop hasn’t confirmed anything with LRC. For your latest news please visit nft.gamestop.com,1636405164,hjun7by
"What?

What does ""LRC hasn't been confirmed"" mean? That's wildly ambiguous. Confirmed by whom?

Wouldn't shills want to ""attack"" any LRC confirming facts, not mentions of there NOT being confirmation?

Are you sure you're just not making sense, and mistaking the downvotes you subsequently receive for an attack?",1636405063,hjumy4r
I use the free Coinbase crypto to buy LRC and I am very close to having enough for another share of GME from the gains,1636405013,hjumtmz
you've lost the plot mate. They found it in the code for the NFT site. They're using LRC layer two. You're just misinformed,1636405011,hjumtgx
"OOKKKOOOKKKK, so you should know better. :)  


I don’t think GS has spoke on the matter, or that their coin/token affects GME in anyway. LRC price does not equal the partnership with LOOPRING",1636404924,hjumloz
Mention that LRC hasnt been confirmed and shills attack hahaha gtfo theres only one true stonk!,1636404898,hjumjc0
"Know what you retards should do? Actually invest in crypto.

I’ve literally been telling you fucks for months that gme is a joke and the money is on crypto. Go look at the roi of fuckin gme, even at its peak, against any worthwhile crypto asset. If you don’t feel like a fucking idiot looking at that, you rrreeeaaally are a fucking idiot.

So now lrc is doing something with gme and you morons perk up? Fuckin lemmings man. Definition if following the crowds.

You guys are my exit liquidity all the time, and I love you for it - but god damn. Please be smarter, this whole pack of retards making terrible investments together thing is getting pretty old.",1637247747,hl4l8wi
"If this is true, Why hasn't LRC coin jumped in price? Or is the coin not related to this whole thing?",1637247665,hl4l1zx
"I agree and I’ve only been around a few months. Seems like every man and his dog knows about the LRC partnership by now. It’s a bad sentiment really, I feel the more people are excited by such news, the more likely to paper hand. Numb/immune to ‘exciting’ news is a good way to ride the rocket and be equanimous with decisions through moass. Alas, it’s good to have something to spice up the weeks.",1637246950,hl4jdz5
"It's not fair! It's not fair!!! 

Why can't Loopring's fantasies come true??? He loves GameStop so much!!!! :(

Guess he'll just console himself with his LRC coins... he's rich now anyway... But if he could convince people they are getting married, he could be EVEN RICHER!",1637246845,hl4j542
"I am trying to picture how that would all flesh out. It could essentially turn the digital game into a physical copy. Log into your device of choice through your Gamestop portal (powered by Loopring NFT protocol) and you can play your console game on your twitch, or your pc, maybe a loan to a friend, or in game exchanges for nft tracked loot that you can sell for LRC and redeem for cash

&amp;#x200B;

these are just thinking out loud ideas, there was another poster explaining if it wasnt handled right and it reduced revenue for the mega corps it would probably never happen. However, I would think there would need to be some sort of agreement for destruction of X% of returned or resold nft by gamestop to prevent a surplus. Something I am pretty sure gamestop does with physical goods currently and has since its inception.",1637246422,hl4i5oz
I guess I’m buying more gme and LRC again then,1637245730,hl4gmaf
"So buy, DRS, HODL, and LRC? I'm in!",1637245669,hl4ghi4
Won't hurt to own a little LRC to see where things go.,1637245160,hl4fdgl

"Typical market behavior. Breathe in, breathe out. LRC is alive. Securities move in wave patterns. It's natural. What happens after breathe out? Oh you know it. Breathe in, nice and deep.",1637244919,hl4euzk
"Can someone explain why LRC is dipping in price despite of all this DD? My assumption is that, rumors have lost their steam &amp; only an official confirmation will raise the price",1637244726,hl4eg7h

"In one month, LRC was a 10 bagger.

There is an absurd amount of money at play here.

People who write on the internet for money are cheap. Making a believable fiction is not impossible, especially for a well motivated team that receive support from an actually intelligent person.

Anyone who has been alive in the last decade know what kind of damage a team of coordinated writers can create on the fabric of our society, why would it be hard to do this in crypto? Just copy a bunch of code, just drop a couple hints, use shills to promote it, day after day after day after day after day after day, make it appear like many people are saying it, curate fake conversations that are made to promote ideas and emotions. Easy-peasy.

We are talking billions of dollars, the average shill is what, 40K per year full time? Even cheaper if you can get them in a country with lower wages (but unfortunately usually it also means worse schools so they are easier to detect).",1637244148,hl4d8ym
"If this were a fraud investigation, no officer would ever say this looks farfetched, this looks very much like motive (they hold LRC thus have to gain from a pump), means (they are in full control of what their GitHub contain) and the opportunity....well it's the internet lol, they can write whatever they want, to ride on Gamestop's coattail, and steal their thunder, while having plausible deniability/impunity being based in China.

Of course, I'm not accusing them of anything, but they are as sus as sus can be, in my eyes",1637243534,hl4c047
i agree. why am i just expecting to be further disappointed? been holding since january and lots of LRC too but just accepted the simulation we live in is pure fuckery and it'll just be more bull shit.,1637243086,hl4b3ue
Why LRC down?,1637242522,hl49zrb

"The bounces are undeniable, let’s hope we break out to the upside. I appreciate all of your TA and how you explain it in simple terms. All this ties in very well with the rumoured Ryan Cohen gagging order ending on Tuesday too. Also LRC looking like it’s wrapping up the project for an unnamed company. Very exciting week coming. Once again thanks for the TA. Very much appreciated OP",1637242246,hl49ggt
then go complain to mom and dad LRC + GME to stop signaling all these sexy hints at us,1637241487,hl480hm
That's what I have been thinking for about two months now since I got into LRC. Would make sense to strengthen the marketplace first and make sure it works how it's supposed to while also troubleshooting along the way with the heavy traffic it will incur. Then after everything is running smoothly is when the NFT dividend would get released. This would help us get more shares too since LRC would skyrocket twice. The first is when the marketplace goes live and the second when the divi gets released and rockets alongside MOASS.,1637241360,hl47rx6
"Good LRC dip right now, just saying...",1637241356,hl47rmi
"Do you know anyone invested heavily in LRC? 

It's looking like it's dipping now, and I for sure fuck am going to let it dip as low as it can and then I am going to forget about it because it's a shitty coin that comes from where the law can't reach",1637241126,hl47bz4

"How realistic is it really that gamestop is able to build this full on NFT marketplace between June and now?  Is that enough time?  I don’t think there’s any doubt that LRC and GME are working together and I’m SO hopeful that there’s some launch this Q, but this seems like a shit ton of work (especially designed from scratch), for 8-9 months.",1637239529,hl44g0z
"Unfortunately the Mods are likely profiting from the spread of this fake news and allowing the LRC community to be burned to the ground by the Apes.  I came with the Apes, but I'm not happy with what they are doing.  Fk the downvotes, I'm just not scared to speak my mind over votes.",1637239176,hl43u3h
"You’re not wrong, and you are being downvoted by crypto bagholders. This is a sad time for this sub. LRC has fallen almost 40% from it’s peak when people started pumping it in here. These posts should be pruned by the mods.",1637238871,hl43bfb
Not yet!  I only have like 400 LRC. I need to load up more first,1637238846,hl439u9
"Still wanted:

Proof that GameStop is committed to Loopring. All I see is aggressive hinting from Loopring, and prolific shilling of LRC by using any tenuous link between one and the other to force this idea that they are together.

I have seen the two new posts that are on the front page... but it's still all actions on Loopring's side... 

People are getting so excited, but all I see is Loopring trying to ride GameStop's coattail.

Please, help me see clearly, I'm going crazy over here!",1637238616,hl42w7d

"Loop doesn’t have the same pressures and such GME has. Loop will probably spike, but it’s not a shorted stock with a low float. A dividend could be used on the loop platform but just a standard LRC would be replicable easily and possibly paid out as cash value.

GME is the real squeeze and has the perfect storm of people that MUST purchase an asset with limited availability.",1637216891,hl3aopm
"Let's say GME issues an NFT dividend. GME creates tokens based on LRC and issues one per share to all shareholders. No cash money changes hands, that's the point. GME does not see an additional dime in their bank accounts. 

So what does your comment, ""Not yet. NFT."" actually mean?",1637216541,hl3a6sq
"Strong banks. My GME ticker is at the top followed by HSI, VIX, SPY, LRC. And then some of GME’s usual ETF basket buddies. Beeteecee and Tesla are also in there. Trying to make the ultimate markers/indicators watchlist so I can get a feeler gauge for things.",1637215673,hl38w77
Popcorn buy lrc too and watch from the cupboard 😁,1637215196,hl385lk
"NFA, but hypothetically, if I stumbled upon $100k and didn't need any of that cash near term, here's what I'd do - 

1. As soon as I was able to, which would be right now in this hypothetical situation, I'd go to ComputerShare.com and directly purchase $85k of GME. This time next week, the trade settles, likely at whatever price GME is around 1030am Monday morning. 

2. I'd buy $4k worth of toys/games from GameStop and donate them to toys for tots.

3. I'd donate $1k of cash to TFT 

4. I'd buy $5k of Loopring coins LRC

5. I'd use the remaining $5k to gamble on some options in mid Dec-mid Feb 2022. I'd probably use half the cash Friday afternoon after the MM crush IV to try and get GME below max pain this week, and use the other half after I'm more confident the latest pull back cycle has finished, but before the Dec future roll period begins on 12/9.",1637206654,hl2smzy
One more question wise friend. is it necessary to set up a Loopring wallet if you already have LRC in CoinB? Can you transfer a CB wallet to an LRC wallet?,1637205839,hl2qy55

"We have been trying to follow it very closely and moderate conservatively. As it stands now we are allowing Loopring discussion as it relates to GME but disallowing straight LRC related discussions.

"[https://twitter.com/DevDevGoat](https://twitter.com/DevDevGoat)

This guy appears to be the bidder on that NFT in page 3, his twitter page links to that ENS domain russlamb.eth.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but anyone could technically bid on that NFT. He could've just found it and placed a joke bid on it. 

Also the transaction from Loopring was him trying to create a L2 wallet on loopring, see this tweet [https://twitter.com/DevDevGoat/status/1454445455623041025](https://twitter.com/DevDevGoat/status/1454445455623041025) (note the timestamp of the tweet same as transaction). 

I think this is just a random ape probably on this sub that just saw the NFT on rarity, decided to bid on it for no reason and coincidentally recently created a loopring L2 wallet. 

Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think this is further evidence of a GME - LRC partnership   
although we already have a lot of evidence :) 

still bullish nonetheless!",1637176431,hl0ux3c
Trying to understand the tit-jacking implications of the whole Loopring thing… are we supposed to invest in LRC as well? Or are everyone’s tetas jacked so hard because the NFT rollout is the beginning of MOASS? Help a guy out here…,1637174736,hl0qn07
Could this be faked at all? Or would it take a lot of effort? I’m all for GME and LRC. Own both!,1637174662,hl0qg69
"I googled around and it seems like MOST of that would just end up as funds in the wallet but nobody seems clear on what percentage ""most"" would be. So frustrating, all the info is clear as mud--don't they WANT more people investing? Why not make it a little simpler for those of us not completely invested in the crypto lifestyle?

And I wanted to buy in now while things are cheaper, I'm assuming the value of LRC will bump once L2 releases and the GME connection is announced?",1637174293,hl0phw9
Yesss they're almost jacked tell me more. It's also proof of a direct link between LRC and Gamestop right? Confirmation of the rumors?!,1637173920,hl0oj33
Something doesn’t make sense to me here. I understand how AMMs are used to provide liquidity for certain (fungible) asset pairs. For example I deposit LRC and ETH into a liquidity pool then earn rewards when people use it to swap their LRC for ETH or vice versa. How do AMMs work with NFTs? How does someone contribute to an LRC/cryptopunk#69420 liquidity pool when there is only one cryptopunk#69420 ever?,1637173068,hl0mcfq

"This is interesting idea. The REAL squeeze isn’t GME (because hedge funds will always find a way to short or stop the squeeze) but it’s through LRC dividends.

"For loopring that represents a longer term bull case. Just imagine if LRC becomes the defacto coin at the point of entry for retail, I'm thinking PayPal/Visa sort of bull case. It'll take 7-15y to get into them realms so it would definitely not be an overnight thing.

I'm talking about Loopring as a network.

"Also hijacking the top comment for little clarification, as there is understandably a lot of confusion around all this (and spoiler, it ends up being *more* bullish):



LoopRing is just a *protocol* for a Decentralised Exchange (DEX)



Think of it as a set of **construction materials** (blueprints, blocks, windows, telephone lines, internet, cables etc) &amp; a **plot of land** to build on, so you can build your own decentralised exchange.


In this metaphor, it would ""cost"" 250,000 LRC to buy this from them. You then build it yourself and cover your own costs to do so.


If you wanted to take the building kit &amp; *not* use the land they provide, it costs you 1,000,000 LRC to do that and still have it use their communication network.



They are not, and never will be, an exchange themselves. 
Nor are *they* going to be actually building an exchange for GameStop. 
What they *do* seem to be doing is adding the functionality that GameStop *requires* in order to be able to build out an NFT Marketplace.



Let me just reiterate that, as I think this is where a lot of the confusion around LoopRing and GameStop's possible relationship stands, GameStop look to be building their *own* Decentralised Exchange - specifically for NFT's, using the building kit that LoopRing are providing.



And it makes sense that if you are looking for a specific feature in your exchange kit that isn't there, well you contact the manufacturer and ask them to include it. 



That would be the direct link between the two. 



Now, from GameStop's side, if LoopRing as a company aren't going to build the exchange for you what do you do?
Well what if you poached 


Well you could always just poach the Head of Business and Operations at LoopRing and use them to build out the team you need to set up the DEX yourself. And that's what Cohen and team did when they got Matt Finestone to leave LoopRing and join them.



Now, coming back around to this post - the inclusion of stock like data (ticker, candles etc.) in the code is to be 100% expected for a protocol that will be used on Decentralised Exchanges.


So while that inclusion doesn't have any direct bearing on GameStop &amp; the direction of any possible NFT DEX, it shouldn't stop you from jacking your tits about the possibilites that exist and that will emerge from the meshing of these two companies.

"Couple things: 

First, this thread is great. Well done /u/SajiMeister - I loved reading this. However, the depiction rendered in the OP is dangerously close to ""securities"" - in which the SEC will demand its own authorization for each and every one. Don't get me wrong, Reg CF passed a few years ago to allow non-accredited retail the opportunity to invest in startups, but this still requires the entity seeking investment to file with the SEC and wait a few months. GME will need to figure out a way around this or hold educational seminars for new startups minting NFTs in how to proceed with SEC involvement. 

Second, if GME was acquiring LRC - apes buying up LRC the last few weeks just made negotiations massively more complicated and expensive for GME. The one play is and has only ever been GME. I sometimes get annoyed seeing so many comments in the last few weeks about people on this sub buying LRC. If OP is correct you fools just made GME pay more for such an acquisition.",1637159975,hkzpq6k

"You're pretty much spot on.


Just a small clarification, they're a DEX **Protocol**, they're not a DEX themselves not will they ever be.


They're the code and ""infrastructure"" that allows *others* to set up a DEX on LoopRing, provided the others deposit 250k LRC to do so (or 1mill LRC for one that doesn't use their on-chain data and runs separate).


You're 100% right in that their code would need to include these items as a base minimum for anyone looking to create a Decentralized Exchange with them.

"It means that this multiday campaign to make people believe that Loopring and GameStop are going to be doing business together and therefore LRC coin has value is still ongoing, and that we have yet to see _a single proof, evidence, news release, confirmation or even a wink_ on GameStop's side. 

I think GameStop will be making its own L2 platform. They don't need Loopring. They have more than a billion dollars and a big blockchain team.

I think this whole thing is a pump, and they are using a PR team to do the pump.

I think people who hold LRC make money by making it seem like it's going to happen. I think certain people should disclose that they hold LRC. I don't hold LRC. I only hold GameStop. 

I think Loopring is trying to ride on GameStop's coattail. They have the most to win. They hold LRC, and they are untouchable in China, it literally can't go tits up for them. Click farms are making these Loopring topics fly to the top. The conversations are not organic, they seem more like ads!

Either a crazy AI or a farming account run full time by multiple people. One strange comment caught my eye when he said Gamestops tweet was intriguing when it was simply a halloween sale tagline. (Usually something AI or foreigners have hard time with)

Also these pats on back in comments reeks of paid shilling.

Not to mention I’ve been in the crypto space for a while, and what he says about GS needing to use LRC makes no sense. GS could easily fork the platform if it’s open source for whatever it does, or better yet make their own ERC20 and raise hundreds of millions.

"When you are compensated in a startup, employees are typically compensated by shares in the form of stock and/or stock options instead of cash. That represents their ""equity,"" so to speak, and they come with restrictions, like most insider shares do initially. You can invest in even more shares on your own if you want, which would be unrestricted.

This is no different. They raised $45 million through their Initial Coin Offering in 2017. That is their version of an IPO. LRC is the equivalent of stock (except in this case, it has other purposes as well).

Matt was hired in 2018 and compensated for the 3 years he worked there in LRC (or LRC options) of the restricted nature -- again, very typical of a fledgling company that has yet to generate revenue. You can call it a stake, equity, shares, or whatever suits you. On top of that, he has also invested further by purchasing LRC (which would not be restricted). He's telling you he still has both.

By stating that he'll remain as a real ""advisor"" is simply a non-binding way of saying they're parting on good terms and if they request his help transitioning someone into his position, he'll give it (assuming there isn't a conflict with his new employment agreement). This type of statement is made ALL THE TIME when people leave companies. It's most common when people retire. Quite frankly, though, companies move on shortly after someone leaves. Matt's replacement may have questions for the time being, but before long, the position will be his to run on his own. EVERY PERSON who makes this sort of statement actually believes they'll remain ""active,"" as if they're irreplaceable, but that's never the case. They aren't employees anymore and won't be used as a crutch any longer than necessary.

"&gt; I think you are missing some things: LRC is a fixed supply resource at 1.2 billion tokens or so and it will squeeze if 1 LRC is needed per 1 share short of GME.

I think that you are missing something as well.  LRC is a utility token, not an NFT.  It actually is fungible.  The value of LRC today is less than $3, and one LRC token is exactly the same as another.  There's nothing to stop the shorts from negotiating a cash value for the dividend in lieu of the actual token.  This is **EXACTLY** what they did with the Overstock crypto dividend, and since LRC actually **IS** fungible (unlike NFTs) that gets them out of having to provide them.  

And even if LRC did squeeze to some absurd number like $25 per token, you're still only talking about $30 billion dollars, spread across all of the funds that are short.  That's chump change.",1637145711,hkz1ojv

"DRS of 100% of the float with brokerage shares still being in accounts would prove fraud without a shadow of a doubt.

If and when that happens, Ryan Cohen and GameStop's fiduciary duty would be to shareholders...which woiuld all be the people and institutions that have DRS'd through CS or filed with the government their holdings. Many of those shareholders would be Apes.

By not doing a share recall to investigate fraud, they would be failing in their fiduciary duty to their shareholders.

This would open them up to be overrun with lawsuits as well as the DTCC and SEC and DOJ all would be open for lawsuits the longer the full float was registered by Apes. Math is a little hard to fudge when you get this far beyond manipulating the laws of economics.

So - LRC and GME say lets make a new game and take our ball and go home. 

GME says cool - I dig your jig funny man. Lets do this.

GME then spends all of the rest of the year warning their shareholders and through government quarterly filings, and probably why they are cooperating with the SEC.

They know they gotta be air tight on the execution this cause they have one shot at making it happen - the risk of this not working would torpedo RC's and millions of shareholders and their net worth.

That means no funny business and EVERYTHING...down to the tweeting...must be legally rock solid within the rules. Luckily RC has a diamond encrusted cock...allegedly.

There is nothing stopping GameStop, after proving fraud and a lack of enforcement by the SEC, from saying I want to reissue securities in a new market. We have a register of every single share now through Computershare and would like you to recall the securities to be reissued. 

Since there is apparently no manipulation to our stock, that shouldnt be an issue right? 

Since everyone has a mayo lubed thumb up their asses that means they should have no issue if GME wants to move their securities to a shiny new blockchain project. You know its all the rage now a days...

I might be a bit far from your request, but I just want to be sure: Are you asking me if GameStop has come out and denied any involvement with Loopring?",1639529865,hol26u1
He didnt code at all. strictly business he said in a video. I agree with the not a dogs fart from gamestop and the aggressive hinting. A guy found a article of LRC ceo or something saying there they have a well known partner and it will be announce by Q4 2021. So Lrc is either going to be a gamestop partner or has been trolling us with a different partner. It seems to me loopring isnt like that and cohen has been friends with them. it's hard out here speculating n shit man lol,1639529697,hol1tuu
"I’ll just say for my two cents: it feels like we’re getting a lot more substantive, business updates regarding GameStop than we ever have before. It was all speculation for the longest.

"And I thought I was an OCD perfectionist ……RC and the gang literally need to have this baby with wrapping and a bow to officially announce the collaboration.

What I’m trying to say is if papers weren’t signed before the LRC drops ownership percentage/lawyer arbitrage would be The reason for not officially announcing anything",1639528586,hokzenv

This is Matt Finestone's farewell letter:

He mentions in the end:

""So what’s next. I am not leaving Loopring because I am tired of it, or because I am not interested in its future. I think you may see from my sappy message above, that is not the case. The fact is, an opportunity has presented itself that I am extremely excited about, and I feel I simply must take. I view it as a once-in-a-lifetime, perfect-timing, far-reaching opportunity/challenge that I need to pursue for its own sake, and for my personal development. I cannot give more information at the moment, but I will be sure to do so when the time is right — I hope on the order of a few months. This opportunity will keep me firmly in the blockchain (Ethereum) space, so I hope to be seeing many of you around real soon :).
I will remain an advisor for Loopring. And not just the symbolic kind, but the real kind. I still hodl LRC, own equity in Loopring Technology Limited, and look forward to remaining part of Loopring’s bright future.

Thank you all for reading,

Matthew""

"And that is part of the tech/financial illiterate confusion on this sub which has (from my POV) started the loopring-gme rumor.

LRC are shares of loopring. In digital finance, tokens ARE shares. Now whether or not that gives you voting power in the company, that's unregulated and up to the underlying company's charter. And last I checked LRC's developers are the major holders of LRC, but shares give zero voting power - part of the reason I'm against Loopring.

There's so much more to this NFT thing. There's hints of it in the recent GME quarterly. WEB3. Look into it - understand the nuances of IT infrastructure before you jump on the LRC hype wagon - which I believe is going to fall off a cliff once GME reveals their own marketplace and takes the industry by storm.

There were typos in the interface. Moving the assets was delayed by mainnet traffic. Submitting a help request took all kinds of info that seemed to exist just to discourage me from asking for help. I don’t think they (Loopring) are ready for commercial prime time, but ultimately they could be if they fix those issues as part of the marketplace effort with GME. That’s why I’d really prefer that GME issue the divvy first while they’re fully vetting and improving the user experience on the broader NFT strategy.

 (I pulled the above from the pasted text from their GitHub.) So, no to your question. I believe this will relate to ""liquidity mining,"" meaning you provide equal parts x/y tokens (2 USDT for 1 LRC, for example, whatever the exchange rate is at the time) and you earn that way. Because it says ""the above seven trading pairs,"" it's referring to seven different pairs of tokens, e.g. LRC to ETH, etc. In less confusing terms, it won't be a reward for just buying LRC, you'll have to provide ""liquidity"" (probably) or participate in some sort of swapping tokens to be eligible.",1639858087,hp32qbx

LRC-USD = $2 (current coin price)

But you can also trade forex (foreign exchange) because the price of currencies also fluxuates.  If Amazon is doing great in foreign countries, but the US economy is collapsing, AMZ-USD could keep going up, even though the USD is going down.

"I'll probably be laughed at, but trust me, even I don't believe in it fully.

However, I have to write about this. I need to get it out of my sistem in case it works.

I have this friend of mine. She's veeeeeery into astrology. I doubt it fully, but to her it makes sense and I respect that. So I usually just listen to what she says because she's so passionate about it but usually shy to go into deep details with our other friends. 

So one day in August I was talking with her about the economy and the future and she tells me that she's been seeing signs there's something huge building up with the economy and regular people's wealth ever since last year and that there's been a shift that started being noticeable since January.

Uhm, okay. Mind you, she's not an ape, nor did I ever talk to her about this before.

So I ask if she can look at her star charts and tell me a date in January when she sees something relevant to the economy.

She takes a second and says ""well, somewhere after the 22nd and up to Feb 3rd or 4th.""

OK, what about other dates after? 

She goes ""February 23rd was important because..."" and she went on about whatever planet transited whatever. I suck at remembering, but followed the idea. 

OK when else?

Well there's the end of May and beginning of June.

I stopped her and asked if she could see if it was about gains or losses. 

She said she could only see if there was something significant happening financially, but she was trying to correlate to other things that could indicate large scale shifts that could affect the whole population.

OK, so can you look at upcoming dates?

And she did. I wrote it down then (pic for proof. This was a few days before the August 23-24 run up)

I'll translate my notes from when she was talking. Again, I never mentioned anything about stocks, GME or anything to her. I just wrote down what she said and interpreted it to my knowledge.

https://i.imgur.com/uLsM4Ht.jpg

""Buy a bit on 2-3. Check what's happening on the 6th.

It starts on 6th, something on the 17th???

21 Oct big day. It happens around 3:36 (PM) New York time. Be set by then.

19 Dec (remember. This day is super important) - up to Jan 1st Venus retrograde. Sunday's the 19th. Maybe Monday moass.

Peak maybe on the 24th - 25th? If it starts in October does it end then? ""An impulse towards accumulation"" an impulsive day. Maybe don't sell? Or maybe precisely sell. A day that lacks good judgement. The relationship between people and loans. You do more to cover needs. You don't go into (ie. touch or spend) money that's not yours. You have to be patient to earn it. Everybody must earn lots of money. Somebody has to confront their debts. Moass then. 19-25 Moass highly probable. Stupid/silly frenzy. 23-24 Dec the final square.

22 Feb - another turn in the American economy. A 200 year financial cycle ends.""

The 22 Feb part was added during a conversation we had on September 23rd 

So I'll recap the dates and mention that despite the fact that I wrote everything on relation to GME, they checked out with other key dates in the world's economy.

1.	September 2nd - 6th: Evergrand trading halted on the 2nd. Bond trading halted on the 6th. That's when that chapter blew open.
2.	September 17th, China pumps money into Evergrand to prevent crisis.
3.	October 21st, not exactly on the date, but that's around when the SEC report came out, the price tanked from 180ish to 160ish, the ComputerShare AMA happened and IIRC that's when the LRC / GME link was pretty much confirmed.


Again, I'm skeptical AF about this (hence why I didn't even thing about sharing it here + I lurk). But the fact someone completely lacking knowledge about the market and about GME could backtrack some dates and hit at least one major one in the future makes me have a slight glimmer of hope that she's right about the Xmas moass. 

I've seen that date talked about before here on superstonk and I hate date anchoring as everyone else here. I'm also following LRC. There's signs there too that there may be an announcement soon between them and GameStop (by eoq/eoy). 

But I refuse to believe something that's this crackpot. I just wanted to have it out of my system in case it's right. 

So if anyone reads this and has a friend or acquaintance that's deep into this whole astrology thing, you could ask them if they can look things up and see what they say.

I'm about to DRS my tinfoil hat too.",1639773318,hoyqdgd
"Sometimes it is okay to say ""I don't know"". In fact, other critical thinkers will respect you deeply and trust you more when they hear it.

You do realize that Finestone's connection led us to Loopring, not Loopring leading us to Finestone. Did Finestone work for both Loopring and Poopring? Do you believe Finestone isn't actually working for Gamestop?

After months of looking into Loopring, the evidence built and a sub to sub relationship was formed when Apes looked into LRC as its own company and joined their community and they mostly welcomed Apes and all their antics. This was months after Loopring was first mentioned. As someone who followed since that time, I can tell you it felt organic.

Regardless, that's my anecdote and it doesn't mean shit. I don't know if Loopring is a scam. You don't know if Loopring is a scam. If you don't have anything new and of substance to provide, there's nothing to convince here. I'm not trying to convince you of anything, just probing to see if you sound exactly like u/cryptocached.

"Bull in mind that I'm 99% GME (and 1% LRC), but just by virtue of popcorn being in the same ETF or basket or whatever instrument SHFs are using to hide their GME shorts, I do think that it's entirely possible that popcorn will have another run-up alongside GME during MOASS. I do think it could hit 100. Easy.

That said, GME is going to the **millions**. For the price of \~5 Popcorn, you're looking at a price target many thousands of times greater. In my opinion, popcorn isn't a hedge, it's a distraction.",1639771508,hoylvsd
"I hear you and appreciate you prepping apes for the possibility but I respectfully disagree for 2 reasons…

By faking a squeeze I think it would cause a major FOMO buy especially around Christmas where families are together talking about the news.

"The problem is no one is willing to take the time to actually understand the technologies, the nuances are important.

==============================

According to GME's Quarterly report, GME is pursuing Web3, finance, and NFTs. This I believe to be a reasonable assumption GameStop is going to try to make an exchange. This is at least from the horse's mouth.

As for LRC, they also are in the finance exchange industry dealing with NFTs. The sub's guess, and what I believe to be pure hype/scam is that LRC and GME are working together.

==============================

Major Bias 1:

To maximize the most out of ZK rolls (zero knowledge validation), it needs to be built on top a web3 network to distribute/parallelize the blockchain computations and decentralize it.

GameStop's network infrastructure contains a vast IPFS  (web3 capable) network, pre-built with multiple nodes. Loopring has only recently (and balls to post the tweet here) started building a web3 capable network.

This makes no sense from a partnership standpoint. On the other hand, GameStop has 10 years of experience working with IPFS.

Neutral Bias 2:

Poached Matt from LRC, considering how GameStop poaches but does not work with Amazon. People say ""white paper"" but you know what? I wrote a white paper on fabric softeners once and left the company the following month. Welcome to capitalism.

Bias 3:

GameStop removed LRC links from being accessible from their IPFS gateway QA environments, but left LRC links and the WWW access open on their sandbox environment.

Cultural Bias 4:

LRC does nothing but hype and talk about a secret partner. Stark contrast to Ryan Cohen and the board's 5 min webcasts every 3 months.

Bias 5:

Transfers both failed and successful of tokens from known LRC related accounts to GameStop's account that contains 300 other scam coins that did the same, not a single return transaction back.

If I was GameStop I would use it as a flag beacon,  and develop on private networks out of reach of ether scan. Too many variables developing new technologies in the cloud. Always local and on-prem first, then roll out to PROD once ready. ""Secrets close to the chest.""

Major Code Bias 6:

Developing on public git repo. I manage contractors - they work on our private repos behind a firewall, leaks don't happen. If we contract out - we'll setup a VPN.

Enterprise lisences for gitlabs are NOT that expensive for large companies. For lone startups it'll kill them.

Futhermore, typing in a public access gateway from GameStop is paramount to accessing their public photo bucket equivalent for programmers. Means jack, and seems over hyped. Heck you can upload to the same gateway if you knew how to use web-apis.

For example when I use to code my backtester, I would use python's request and Oauth lib to visit the REST servers of eTrade. Does that mean I work for Etrade? Fuck no.

Bias etc... I could go on, but at this point is all noise.",1639767323,hoyb959

"So these are called Red Packets. 

As per Loopring’s website:

&gt; Red packets, or red envelopes, are a traditional Chinese gift-giving custom on special occasions, celebrations, and the Chinese New Year. Giving red envelopes filled with cash to friends, family, and coworkers, in hopes of blessings and good fortune. The colour red is associated with good luck, and the cash is, well, cash. Except for now it can be Ethereum-based assets too!

You can send 3 types of red packets:
1. Relay red packet. Specify a total amount, and a number of people. Recipients get a random share of the packet amount. If they share it with others via QR code, they get half the amount that next person receives as well.
e.g.: I send a red packet for 1000 LRC, to be split among 10 recipients. You find one, open it up. You receive 83.5 LRC (random amount). You click share, which generates a new QR code for you, and you share it on Twitter. Someone opens it, it’s for 95 LRC (random amount). They receive 47.5 LRC, you receive 47.5 LRC.
2. Lucky red packet. Specify a total amount, and a number of people. Each person gets a random share of the total packet amount. The distribution is randomized.
e.g.: 1000 LRC, 10 recipients. You find one, open it up. You receive 83.5 LRC (random amount). Someone else opens it up and receives 125 LRC. And so on.
3. Normal red packet. Specify a total amount, and a number of people. Each person gets the same share of the total packet amount.
e.g.: 1000 LRC, 10 recipients. You find one, open it up. You receive 100 (1000/10). Someone else opens it up and receives 100 LRC. And so on.",1639766712,hoy9nfy

"Key Summary -&gt; This code is CONFIRMING Loopring and Gamestop partnership because

A) Code is added to MAIN loopring github (their main code repository)

AND

B) This code is calling Gamestop domain (gstop-sandbox.com, confirmed to be owned by Gamestop) to get the NFT values

AND ALSO

C) NFT is confirmed because it is going to nft.gstop-sandbox and it is using web3 ethereum contract and function name has NFT in it

*********************************************************

This is LITERALLY the holy grail

confirms GME and LRC partnership

confirms it has to do with NFTs

***************************************************************

DETAILS

Rough Translation (someone can update this if they are more familiar with this code than I am)

A) get Contract NFT Meta -&gt; This is a FUNCTION that goes and gets a NFT Contract

So NFT confirmed

*************

B) async -&gt; asynchronous. Other things can keep happening while this function is running

Might or might not be important, as it means multiple NFT contracts can be pulled at the same time

and/or

this can be running at the same time as other stuff is running (which is obviously good as you don't want one thing blocking everything else)

*************************

C) Contract is a constant that is an Ethereum Contract

address of the contract is something that is passed to the function

* this sort of confirms ETH based NFT contract

***************

D) There is a constant called gameStopMeta being created which is getting its value from gamestop sandbox url (gstop-sandbox.com) - which is a verified Gamestop owned domain

MOST IMPORTANT: on loopring official code repository and accessing gamestop owned domain

and nft sub domain of gamestop domain

This is basically proof that it's NFT based SOMETHING and LRC and GME partnership

"Oh I definitely agree, more signs point to it being truthful than not. However, I think it's important to be aware what can be faked and what can't be. I mention this in my post that I linked - there's people sharing this assuming that Github saying ""windatang"" means it's definitely by windatang, like how Reddit saying a comment is by your username means it's definitely by you. I think it's important to call out that this is wrong, Github doesn't work like that fundamentally.

As for why, well, _if_ this is fake, pumping LRC would be a good reason to have faked something like this. I've seen more elaborate scams than this when it comes to cryptocurrency, and it's not unreasonable someone looked at this subreddit and saw an opportunity to bend the narrative and make a quick buck.

"I understand loopring is a not for profit organisation registered in Hong Kong, so not a company. 

I also understand LRC will go to the moon and that NFTs are not just pretty pictures. 

Recently popcorn 🍿 offered nfts with a ticket purchase. Over 80,000 NFTs with over 100 unique designs. So at least 800 of each design and I do not understand how these are considered NFTs. The NFT is the token but if 800 tokens are identical they are in fact fungible and therefore not NFTs. A unique serial number doesnt make something non fungible as is clearly the case with dollar bills. My $100 is absolutely swappable with yours (with rare exception where there are misprints or perhaps a particular number or set of numbers)

There will certainly not be misprints of the Spider-Man NFTs so the only distinguishing character will be the serial number - which to my mind makes them fungible for the most part.

"A few things:

Dark Side Of The Moon is an interesting reference. Firstly, what has always been the goal of all crazy diamond (hands)? The moon obviously.

We all know that we'll reach the moon, however it won't be via the trajectory and path that we initially thought it might. We'll be taking a circuitous route. One that is, as of now, shrouded in secrecy. One that will take us to places as-of-yet discovered. 

When we moon, it will be due in no small part to blockchain technology.  We won't be landing on the light side of the moon. Where we're going, no one has ever gone before. The dark side of the moon.

Before man was ever sent into space, they first tested space flight with ape pilots. Well apes, we are gathered here as the first astronauts to ever journey to the dark side. We are the test dummies. 

We, as investors, are not 100% certain what the final nail in the hedgie coffin will be, but we now understand that it will have SOMETHING to do with LRC, NFTS, and blockchain tech.

Shine on You Crazy Diamond is an ode to Sid Barrett. He was a beautiful genius,  a visionary. I believe these tweets are an ode to us, the shareholders. We are crazy, diamond-handed, smooth-brained visionaries in our own right. We, despite what the rest of the world has been telling us, have seen enough to understand that GME is the opportunity of a lifetime, and this future moon landing would not have been possible without us.

"yes, you can buy LRC, or other crypt0 on an exchange.  You can then choose to leave your asset within the exchange account, or you can transfer it to a digital ""wallet"".

"If an association is there and Gamestop announces something associated with them, marketplace/platform/whatever, then the smart money would be to have bought more GME not throw into a speculative coin. Announcement? GME can catalyst. No announcement? Congrats on the crypt pump and dump.

Either way buying lrc is a lose lose compared to just getting more shares of GME assuming one actually read the DD and even remotely thinks shorts didn't cover. The constant spamming this sub saw fairly recently definitely points to people cluttering reality and sliding.",1639043803,hnu30l1
"People are simply ignoring the fact that some of these guys really like money. I definitely saw it as a way to pump up a few stocks/coins (lrc) to gain profits and cash it away. LRC pumped yesterday solely for anticipation of gme. Some of them might want to ride the wave and profit off of it.

1) NFT and web 3.0 (metaverse) investments/risk
2) a 5 million count of Gamestopv""DRS"" shares (direct held, non broker, non ""Cede and Co"") as of Oct 30

This confirmed some favorite superstonk theories:
LRC/Gamestop market for used games, L2 rollup NFTs, created content maybe a NFT dividend? recently some folks spotted source code (github) showing LRC lvl 2 plus GME metadata. Also lots of NFT and Web 3.0 jobs/hires at Gamestop

Direct registering shares removes them from the pool of broker short lending - enough will expose fraud and may trigger a huge short squeeze if enough people diamond hand it.  GME putting it in their filing today (for the 1st time ever) is a huge legitimizer of this theory.",1639037717,hntvxej

Could you comment on where GME might hide the purchase of $300,000 LRC if they did such a thing. LRC being a crypto token and Loopring being a not for profit organisation based in Hong Kong.

Because of the use of the word “crypto” I’m guessing as there have been much ado about cryptonic elements that arrived on earth because a certain someone sent their kid off in a spaceship. Then the dolphins grew legs and taught us exactly how smart they were. Crypto is now the communication of all species because ( however smart these dolphins claimed pahhhh!!) they still can’t speak idiotic human mumble jumble. So any way there was also this place where kids never grew up because somebody else would kill them as soon as they reached a specific age because that someone wanted a never land filled with kids forev. Peter was his name and Jackson was his surname. But this fucked up leader of never land also found crypto in the mountains due north pass the enclave forest of insanities gone amiss where they found. Lord Ryan Cohen or LRC for short.. haha short. And he had invested into a whole new kind of never land where retail investors finally felt a win. -Crypto,1638995971,hnrikcb

Talk about Loopring and its connection to GME all you like.  There is lots to explore although much of it is based on speculation and leaks.  No one wants to suppress info on this. 

The issue is, like it or not the sub is getting spammed by LRC threads and full blown brigading from the LRC sub.  This sub is about GME and if it relates to GME it's kosher.  If its just about the loop ring coin its going to get removed.  Your post was fairly high effort and I can appreciate the sentiment.  There is no right answer here but the community has voiced their opinion pretty loud and clear.

Reminds me of GameStop back to $20 by the infamous.... ""fill in the blank""

DigitalCoin sees Loopring gaining plenty more value through the end of this year. The site’s year-end forecast for LRC is $5.13. 

Trading Beast’s median prediction of $3.15 for December has already been smashed through; its high prediction for the month is $3.94. 

WalletInvestor’s 12-month prediction for LRC is quite bearish, targeting a value of $1.86 by November of next year. 

Gov Capital’s prediction for November of 2022 also calls for some big losses. It expects Loopring to sink down to $2.50 by then",1636652314,hk85v6g
"LOL I was silenced right here for posting about LRC - related to GME - about a week ago. Keep it going, though.",1636652069,hk858vu
"Correct. Based on my theory, All GME owners gain from LRC mooning.",1636652030,hk855d1
"I mean, I was just talking about LRC, not what they might be doing with GameStop. If it's LRC it doesn't mean it has some kind of RC layer of protection from the SHFs that can just pump it and then dump it via various tactics, including hyping it.

I have some also but I think until the announcement, we should tone it down a notch when it comes to LRC and focus on GME and GameStop more.",1636652012,hk853p4
No I'm not because I'm on that sub all the time and LRC is heavily discussed.,1636651984,hk8510z
My view leading me to buy LRC right now is similar except this is like buying GME when it was around $40 dollars at the current price and once the announcement is made it’ll rocket up too (who knows how high) and may even precede the squeeze (assuming dividend not released simultaneous yo public announcement) and maybe the initial rocket can be rolled over into a few last minute GME shares. May be flawed thinking as a lot of my thinking is.,1636651854,hk84p70
"there are real connections between LRC and GME. what they all mean and how much is going on right now behind the scenes is anyone's guess. however, GME is a large pile of TNT, and any old day any old spark could light it. the NFT marketplace will happen. it could be a spark. it could be THE spark. a lot depends on how it comes out and the nuts and bolts and scale of it all. either way it is a very good thing as NFT's are the future. im still of the opinion that there will be a catalyst none of us thought about and when it hits it will hit hard. any day. im ready.",1636651726,hk84dev
"Exactly one month ago, LRC traded for $0.36 per token. It now trades for 10 times that amount. This token has not been added to EFTs, etc yet. Somebody is buying big and it's not just apes.",1636651406,hk83k66
I mean someone is we should look at the LRC top transactors and see who is holding and what they are doing with it.,1636651314,hk83boj
"You say that GameStop has likely been buying tons of LRC, do you have any indication of that beyond theory?",1636650937,hk82dj9
"Interesting! So to utilize their platform you have to stake a million. That’s different than I was thinking (I’m crypto-illiterate). That seems pretty cool but I imagine GME could still make deal to not need that or work around it as a big contributor to Loopring use. Although you’d need to change protocol to allow GME to use without a stake i guess. . .

Still Loop could have given a million LRC to GME from insiders coins. Idk. Speculation is fun, but should remain speculation none the less.",1636650879,hk828cu
"I see what you are saying, but the protocol is designed to have hosts stake 1M LRC as a way to keep bad actors out. They can't take peoples money and run without losing their stake as it can be confiscated. It also sets a high cost of entry so anybody who wants to establish an exchange has to be pretty serious about it.",1636650661,hk81onz
"If it is the case, I'm sure Gamestop would have already secured enough LRC coin early on in development.",1636650475,hk817yk
i just dont see why they pump money into $lrc.  loopring getting infinite money from RC.  my non-financial advise is to buy $GME,1636650450,hk815rp
"I don’t know much of the details, but there are too many possibilities to speculate. This is a huge collaboration if the rumors are true so you could speculate they worked a deal to not need to buy LRC. They may have bought LRC. They may have designed a whole new crypto coin to use on a L2 platform that uses their zkrollup. They could have had Loopring design a layer 2 platform for them that uses some of Loopring technology. They could have plans to buy Loopring outright.

All speculation. Not saying people are wrong, just saying it can be exhausting to follow each hype post that is pure speculation. Zen is always best.

I should also mention (again speculation) that I don’t think GameStop is hosting LRC on an exchange. That is what Coinbase does. GameStop would be utilizing their L2 technology to create a NFT marketplace to sell some form of NFT. Not buy and sell LRC.",1636650449,hk815n9
We can talk about Loopring the company NOT pump lrc the coin...two very different things,1636650363,hk80y0d
"It's an interesting idea.   Implies I should be bought into LRC to profit from that jump....but....my brokers won't sell it to me...so I'd need to set up a new account...and I believe in the rocket I'm on.  My personal theory is diversification is for those that lack conviction.  Also, as I consider it, even if this is accurate, it just would mean that by owning gamestop, I own some LRC by the transitive property anyway.",1636650273,hk80q0l
"New crypto getting hype? New crypto investors flooding the sub with no knowledge of the space? Tons of posts from noobs saying ""buy LRC stock""? All the comments are very basic questions about block chain etc? 

Yep, that's annoying as hell and those subs experience it all the time.",1636650203,hk80jo3
"The only problem is you buy LRC on L1 and you have to pay gas to get it to L2. 

I transferred my 1st batch of LRC from Coinbase to Trust Wallet which cost gas. Then I wanted to add it to their LP which requires ETH so transferred ETH from Coinbase to Trust Wallet which cost more gas. Then I transferred both to [app.loopring.io](https://app.loopring.io) which cost gas for both transactions, and then gas to change both from L1 to L2. Finally I believe it was another gas fee to add liquidity. IIRC that's what I had to do, and don't remember the fees specifically but they all added up to a hefty price that doesn't make to worth to withdraw until I've made a sizable reward return. Admittedly I'm pretty retarded when it comes to LPs so don't yet know when that will be but got in at 0.42 and in no rush. I almost stopped the process when the fees kept piling up but realized quitting would mean never recovering the fees.

Point being, I don't know the benefit for transferring from L1 to L2 outside using it in a LP. I have more LRC on an exchange (I know) and besides putting in in L1 storage to hold I don't what else I'd do with it that would be advantageous.",1636650136,hk80dof
"To host an exchange, you need atleast 1,000,000 LRC.",1636650096,hk80a38
"Not trying to be a jerk but some people have been posting gains which isn't allowed and diverts from the purpose of the sub.

I am genuinely excited about the loopring stuff though and always happy to read about what's going on because I do think that it's important.

It's just a fine line between talking about the (possible) partnership and people saying that they've 8x their money on LRC or that they're going to invest in LRC and spend profits on GME. 

We just need to be careful at times and I think that some people are trying to blur the distinction between Loopring and LRC.",1636650077,hk808cq
"I'm looking around for verification on their main site on this and haven't found it, yet. 

but if it were the case, then why shill LRC coin and try to get the price to increase so if GME buys in, they would need to at a higher price?",1636650036,hk804ol
"To host an exchange on LR, you need to have atleast 1,000,000 LRC as per LR protocol. So if they are partnered at all, gamestop has a shit ton of LRC.",1636649980,hk7zzf6
"APE REMINDER 🦍 🍌 


I’m writing this from my toilet ayyy


With all the LRC/GME finds, we are almost able to TASTE the beginning of the MOASS, so I recommend everybody to…

MAKE A MOASS ACTION PLAN!
Call you bank, make sure that the process of getting your MOASS bananas into your account is squeaky clean. You don’t want to have your bananas to be frozen or anything during the withdrawal. Ask your bank about what happens when you deposit a large sum of money. Plan on maybe doing multiple smaller deposits to avoid avoid any issues. 

If you can’t transfer to. ComputerShare for whatever reason, contact your broker. Confirm with an agent that they will NOT limit any buying and that your post MOASS bananas can be SAFELY withdrawn. 

Prepare yourself in case Reddit goes does, have a portable cellphone charger in your bag, make sure you have wifi and/or data in case you aren’t home. Have contingency plans in case MOASS while you aren’t in your battle station. 

RECORD OR SCREENSHOT/CAPTURE any chat logs or emails you use for communication. Get references numbers, make sure you have receipts for literally everything. If it helps, go ahead and even print out the screenshots and emails so that you have a crystal clear case that your bananas are yours. 

MOASS is soon, let’s go to Andromeda safely 🚀 🦍 🍌",1636649770,hk7zg7g
ok everything i’m about to say is complete speculation.   not advice and just guessing.      GMe recently set up an asset backed credit line.  what if the asset is an amount of LRC or other token that was purchased to facilitate the nft marketplace?   when they announce or in some future filing they’d indicate how much of the coin they hold and it’s estimated value.  maybe the filing for the credit line indicated the asset which would totally debunk this.,1636649716,hk7zb7x
"How loopring lvl 2 might be used as part of a GME NFT marketplace ✅

My sweet sweet LRC gainz ❌",1636649521,hk7ytfj
I think most everyone has accepted the loopring partnership as fact by now. My guess would be people don’t want to see owning the float of GME in jeopardy because money is being put into LRC instead.,1636649330,hk7ybp5
"I tried linking the source and my comment was removed by the automod. Look at cryptocurrencymeta sub for proof. People have been organizing on discord to brigade, mass downvote anti LRC comments and upvote pro LRC comments. Not at all hard to find.",1636648952,hk7xd8s

"Brigading. You know, the entire reason LRC discussion is banned from the crypto sub and why this thread exists in the first place?",1636648680,hk7wo63
"Lmao holy shit. Do u even do any research or do u drink straight paint and go to ur computer?

Do u think ppl who buy gme are the only ones who can hold? Like seriously. Also not many apes own LRC. If crypto crash it doesn't matter to us.


Also, crypto is very much tied to Bitcoin. If u or apes could stabilize the price of Bitcoin, we wouldn't need MOASS at all. Unless u don't control Bitcoin, u don't control LRC at all. If crypto would crash to the ground (which it won't), LRC would easily be at -95% like the rest.",1636648277,hk7vna1
"&gt; because as with GME apes own it and apes set the price.

dangerous thinking here, lots of apes have not bought in to LRC. Dont let the SHFs rug pull you if it happens to be a P&amp;D.

"agreed with all this sentiment.  My sentiment is not anti-loopring.  Ive converted some of my freebies over to LRC through coinbase and am a hodler.  My sentiment is more that this is a GME sub, and until its known beyond the shadow of a doubt that this is a legit partnership and deserves a spot in this sub, it doesn't deserve a spot on this sub.

We don't talk about popcorn or the other meme stonks here, and if they are talked about it gets quickly shut down.  Because these are two separate, distinct entities that while are ""related"", are not the same.

"I aggree that it should be discussed when relevant to GME. Of course 'lrc moon tiem' has no place here. That's not what people are saying though - they are advocating for NOT talking about LRC period.

Also, the price of LRC could be related to gme, for example it could indicate upcoming announcements as insiders buy in.

And yes, I am invested in LRC and I am biased. Does this mean I should not be able to talk about it?",1636647288,hk7t6bt
"I agree with the sentiment and discipline you’re expressing. At the same time, Loopring is like a vitamin that keeps one’s tits jacked about GME too.   It’s good for long term endurance and engagement.  My ape friends are buying low doses of LRC for shits and giggles.  Not enough to make them sell their gme shares or to stop continuously drsing.  

It’s ok if moass take a little longer than anticipated because it’s an even bigger win if we’re not subjected to long-term capital gains down the road.  Based on my perception of ape behavior (could be wrong of course), I don’t think apes are paper-handing at all due to interest in Loopring.  We’ve been hodling and have turned into hoarders of shares.  It’s healthy  in this context lol. When the time comes, it’ll be hard to sell too.  These shares are woven into my identify.

Good luck with your investment, and I hope LRC does well for apes who decide to invest in it, but we don’t need this sub to turn into another crypto pump fest. 

I talk about bitcoin a lot on this sub…when it’s relevant to the discussion. That’s all we are saying. Keep LRC comments/posts relevant to GameStop discussion. The price of LRC has nothing to do with GameStop, posts that are specifically about the price just cause unnecessary FOMO. If the partnership is legit, which I suspect it is, big things will happen for LoopRing in the coming months/years. You don’t need people pumping the price for you, just like I don’t need people posting about the price of Bitcoin.

Huh? How does people ComputerShare DD change this from a GME sub. It is literally showing shareholders how to own stock of **GME** in their own name to prevent manipulation of the **GME** stock.

"Loopring the business is involvement with GME, which looking at the code and how it connect is important. But the actual Loopring coin has little if any involvement with the business of Gamestop, so it shouldn’t be allowed. You said LRC sub is bumping, bring your LRC talk there.

NO LRC TILL AFTER CRYPTO/BTC/USDT CRASH


Now that I have your attention let’s talk about this little old company called gamestop with a tiny market cap and over 221% (max reportable) short interest. 

Now over 10% SI is bad, over 40% is devastating above that? unheard of. It would cripple not just an economy but THE GLOBAL economy for at least a few long tedious weeks/months. 

Moass/♾ is not a meme and it WILL unfortunately devastate retail portfolios which is why $GME should BE BLASTED ON BILLBOARDS AND ON LOUDSPEAKERS TILL EVERY ONE CAN GET SOME CAKE. 

That is our duty as humans who’ve all been in the rat race for too damn long.

That's exactly right. But how does LRC fit into that discussion? Seeing that it is neither a stock nor related to GME.

&gt;Specifically means different things depending on the context,

It really does not. Specifically is used to specify something on a specific thing.

Here is the definition from Google:
""
1: in a way that is exact and clear; precisely.

2: for a particular purpose.""


&gt; Which loopring definitely is at this point. 

I'm not arguing that it isn't


&gt; We aren't exactly sure how LRC will be relevant, 

This is the crux of the issue. No one is sure and there is no *reliable* and *viable* information on it. For all we know these wallet addresses are all a hoax. We simply do not know at this point. And that is ok. It could be just an entirely separate project, or not related. 

Point is: we don't need to care until there is something material to care about otherwise you're just living in your feelings. 

&gt;speculation would point to lrc being used for transactions with the loopring wallet and for minting NFTs on their platform which is heavily speculated to be what their marketplace will enable. 

*speculated*. Uncertainty. Until something material comes out we don't know anything. Speculating on it might be fun but demanding rights to have it all over the place all the time is madness. Feel free to do that over there.


&gt;It's either LRC or ETH that will be needed to burn to mint NFTs and I would put my money on it being LRC. That's pretty relevant if gme is going to start a marketplace with loopring to mint and trade NFTs. 

Yes but Ethereum already has market penetration and acceptance. Again, we don't really know, why should, or would we pretend that we do?


&gt;Everyone should be aware of scams not sure what that has to do with anything though. Personally I haven't seen any though and I spend more time than I should on this sub and others.

Precisely. Everyone should be, but alas they are not. How does allowing the propagation of this help the community?

&gt;Not a flex just saying I've been around and understand the type of forum sliding that has been on gme subs and this ain't it. 

Says who? 

&gt;The fact that the head of Blockchain has said he is still hodling his lrc is a huge reason why it shouldn't be frowned upon. 

I'm not saying it should be frowned upon. I'm beginning to think though. 


&gt;You can think whatever you want but your inability to be open-minded and engage in discussion is something you may want to reflect on. 

I'm a very open minded individual. I manage my money on facts and verifiable information. 

Do you know why the DD's that have shed light on this have gained traction on this forum? Because the information is from verifiable and reliable sources and you can read the primary and secondary sources yourself. Not take some random dudes fucking word on it.

"**Important is to learn about ""asymmetric investments"".**

**Little risk, but massive potential. Both LRC and GME are asymmetric investments. Their potential is incredible and the price is still fair.**

Now compare that to the major crypto coin. Life changing money usually needs an insane ROI... 10000% for example (100x the money invested)

LRC has the potential to go to 30, maybe even 300+ in the longer term.

GME has infinite potential, shares going to 20k in a squeeze happened before, but we talk about an infinity squeeze, something that has never happened and will never happen again in the stock market. It will be exciting to see, where price will spike out, might be insane numbers.

Now compare that to investing into a crypto coin, that already ripped to 60k. For 10k% ROI you would need price to go to 6M USD per coin. To me this investment would make no sense at all - massive risk and little potential.

As we’ve seen with CMKX, registering the float may not be enough. What if GME wanted to allow total registration of the float, and then some? Let us think we’ve got 1/10th the amount we do, so apes don’t slow down. Ironclad proof that they registered 1.5x the float…they do a “stock offering”, but only enough to cover that discrepancy. Immediately tokenize all the registered shares, and start the countdown to resolution or else they move their entire security to an already established exchange they control? Where you can on ramp fiat, buy GME shares, LRC and all the crypto pairs they offer,  and NFTs of all kinds once minting starts?

Imagine building up all this hype for this and telling everyone that Loopring and L2 are necessary for building this potential NFT marketplace and then finding out that the partner is someone else.

"5.	yes. If you’re comfortable with impermanent loss, provide liquidity! There may be future options within the ecosystem to stake and trade the liquidity provider tokens for compounding gains. There will most definitely be liquidity mining programs, where they offer incentives to provide liquidity for specific pairs. There will also be an insurance fund, where staked tokes earn interest from providing a backing to those LP tokens that get shafted by big movements. There will also be a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), where LRC tokens held give you a vote in how Loopring moves forward. Even one token matters, immutable say in the project’s direction. So you can be a market maker. You can lend out your currency and reap the benefits that banks have been hoarding your money and profiting from. You can also tie a debit card to your LRC account (eidoo?) and use your LRC to pay for things at a store. I wouldn’t doubt that soon, there will be lending platforms to loan people money for interest. Hell, one of the pairs offered on Loopring’s DEX does just that…SMARTCREDIT? Basically, anything a bank has been able to do for the last 100 years due to scale, that you couldn’t, is now working reach, for individual whales and minnows alike. 
6.	NFTs. So hot right now. Yeah, pixelated jpegs going for the price of a house. Solid chain of ownership of a digital asset. Movies. Music. Art. Certificates. Anything that can be digitized and ownership means something. Maybe in-game items. Maybe games themselves. All your personal data that Facebook and instagram make a killing off of. Whoever wants to make a platform using the loopring protocol will tap into consumer (and provider)-friendly markets that don’t even exist yet. DRM only benefitted big players…what if your could drm everything you put in the net? So yes, Ethereum is currently **the** nft platform. But gas fees are squeezing out anyone who’s not a whale. Once again, a playground for the rich. But an NFT platform that batches transactions into one block and spreads out that cost? And you never have to interact with L1 and its gas fees? With all this metaverse stuff, unique digital items are likely to become very hot, especially if a platform requires you to be the owner on-chain. And if the gas fees are payable in any ERC20 token, but preferentially eth and LRC? Big boost to both. And LRC being deflationary only makes it more coveted. 

The recent announcement and wallet give people the opportunity to try this ecosystem out on the ground floor, and only pay the fees if they feels it’s truly worth it. It’ll probably be worth it to not ever go to L1. If all volume moves off L1 onto the various L2 and side chains, with L1 serving as the backbone wholesale chain, it’ll make L1 more efficient by orders of magnitude, while also driving value of those L2 chains. Those various L2 chains will also connect soon, I would think. It’s not a “Kong of the Mountain” situation. It’s very Buddhist, such zen, much wow: there are many paths up Sagarmartha (I probably fucked that quote up).

Love the format, helps me respond without going off on tangents.

Disclaimer: I am not an expert. I started learning this summer. I just finished my biology + psychology double major, minor in chemistry, so this is far from any experience I have. Plus I just gnoshed two melatonin chewables on top of some beer, so I make zero promises.

1.	Essentially, yes. I would put Eth as a second gen currency. They’ve built it with some of the shortcomings of BTC in mind, and an eye to the future. The ecosystems of DeFi that you mentioned are huge, and what really differentiate Ethereum from Bitcoin.
2.	gas fees. Yeah, they suck. Proof of work isn’t really the problem. It’s a good system, but it’s got its flaws. But almost anybody can set up a mining rig to validate. The issue is the massive movement of activity onto the network, with all the aforementioned DeFi protocols. Shots clogged, and even the smallest activity is prohibitively expensive. This means miners are happy, they’re making bank, but there’s not enough of them to handle the load. Ethereum had a few targets as recently as September, of moving from proof of work (hardware miners) to proof of stake (holding and committing eth tokens for a decentralized validation network where small holders could participate in pools operated by those more tech savvy) and implementing ‘sharding’ (I’m murky here; breaking up transactions across the network so multiple validators can confirm? It was to improve the scalability across the network). They have since dropped sharding off the schedule, focusing on moving to PoS in the wake of the rise of zero knowledge rollups, which accomplish the scalability targets, and then some, of sharding without an entire network upgrade. Basically, don’t do two things okay, do one thing very well, and let others provide a solution. 
3.	pretty much. It’s any standard layer 1 transaction that can be rolled up. The more transactions, the more that can be batched in the same block, the cheaper it gets for everyone. I’m not certain if smart contracts can be accomplished in zkRollups, but I’m sure the loopring team is working on that.
4.	Loopring has a DEX. The things you mentioned are there. But that is one feature of Loopring. Specifically, it is the protocol upon which those things can be built, their DEX is a proof of work (heh) of such functionality. As I understand it, anyone who wants to stake between 250k-1m LRC can build any such platform on their protocol. If the DEX is a building, Loopring is not the building…it is the cement, steel structure, bricks, insulation and wiring of the building. It is more than any one building.",1640339725,hpskd7y

"Can I get some help making sure I understand very high level WTF is going on with ETH, Loopring, ZK-rollups, etc?
I messed around with BTC early on, mined, made some $, lost wallets (😭) but I wanna make sure I understand this stuff. Gonna try this format, let me know if I'm wrong on something:

1. ETH is ""like"" BTC, ""digital currency"" but the whole chain allows smart contracts and dApps too. You make the smart contracts/dApps ""work/run"" with ETH.
2. Moving all the ETH around costs something, so there's gas, a fee. And the way the chain works (proof of work?), these fees are high.
3. Zero knowledge gets implemented and L2 (Loopring) exists, it batches up a bunch of trades (LRCxUSD, LRCxETH, LRCxBTC, etc) and records it into the ETH chain so fees are cheaper (rollups)
4. Loopring is basically a decentralized exchange (DEX) of digital currencies (with on/off ramps to fiat currency) allowing people to exchange and move digital currency for less fees.
5. You can basically park a bunch of digital currency (LRC, BTC, ETH) in a ""self owned"" bank account and earn interest since you're providing liquidity, basically being your own bank.

I'm confused where NFTs come in. An NFT is basically a dApp on the ETH chain(?) and so instead of minting them and then transferring them all on L1 with high gas, the ""trades/transfers"" of NFTs happens on L2 to reduce fees and then the transactions get recorded on L1 chain?

Is any of that *at all* correct?

Edit: and so the latest announcements are good because... If I wanna try this all out... Instead of having to obtain ETH, then basically get that turner into L2 digital currency and pay a bunch of gas... I can now just, buy L2 digital currency (LRC) directly on L2 with a $ on ramp, avoiding the L1&gt;L2 high gas fee?",1640318825,hprq2jq

I will remain an advisor for Loopring. And not just the symbolic kind, but the real kind. I still hodl LRC, own equity in Loopring Technology Limited, and look forward to remaining part of Loopring’s bright future.

Thank you all for reading,

"Yea people need to cool it with the LRC stuff. Nothing is official until it is. There was a big railroad merger this past year between KCS and CNR.TO that was all but done…. Until it fell through at the absolute last second. 

Until GME says so I look at them and LRC as completely independent identity’s.

Buy HODL DRS🟣",1640245928,hpnr645
"Thank you for response. I was wondering when Loopring makes announcement what that will do to LRC price. I have limited insight into cryptoe, but I've been a stock investor for 12 years. I was just asking to see if anyone had any thoughts about future price predictions",1640245089,hpnq2xd
That's what I was figuring I would do. One more question. Will it be too late to buy LRC by that point because the price might have already skyrocketed?,1640244002,hpnom3z
activating it confusing af like i have 500 lrc but it wants eth so i bought 100 of eth and waiting to see if it will accept it to activate the wallet,1640243830,hpnodkd
"Just download the app. Soon you can buy directly from the app. If you buy from coinbase and transfer to Loopring wallet you have to pay gas fees, and they’re pretty expensive. Loopring is about to update the app so that you can buy directly into layer two Loopring. Once you have layer two LRC then you can spend it or use it with way less fees/ gas. We are very early. I’m just hodling and buying for now.",1640243141,hpnnf1y
"To make a L1 wallet u need to pay for gas fees. I think the L2 might be free but you gotta choose the right options when creating (loopring wallet, not eth wallet) if that's what u want. If ur going for the L1 wallet, you can either pay with a crypto like lrc and eth or usd. The qr code has a wallet address under it, so if ur transferring money or crypto from another wallet, u can just copy that address bc that's where ur sending ur crypto. Otherwise, i think u can just pay in dollars from a bank, but i haven't tested that yet. Be careful with L1 if u don't want to pay for a wallet, cuz that costs gas fees.

I think loopring had a link to their tutorial on their Twitter.",1640239701,hpnidee

"Somehow stumbled upon this post stalking your profile based off another comment. Thank you OP for this post. I am shocked that this didn’t get much traction/attention. 

Everything outlined is EXACTLY what GME x LRC is doing. It’s clear as day and all but officially confirmed. The media gaslighting and fud is ridiculous. 

You don’t have to be SME like yourself to understand that GME is about to turn some fucking heads and change the game forever. 

Can’t stop. Won’t stop. GameStop!",1640238377,hpngaeq
The protocol is most known for the Ethereum LRC token. Loopring relies on a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm to verify and generate new blocks on the network. Miners get rewards in the form of Loopring tokens. The LRC burn rate increases the token's scarcity by burning a portion of the fees that comes from the wallets.,1640238224,hpng1ms
"I do not care if LR partnered with GME or not, it would be cool and may lead to an earlier MOASS, but GME is not reliant on LR. We have old reliable, DRS.

I would however, call for bans on LR post if GME is proven not to be partnered with them in anyway.

I appreciate the post theorize links and partnership benefit of the two, but there's been some post that just straight out pushes LR and subtlety encourages purchasing LRC.

Crypto and NFT ""bros"" tend to like pump and dumps, and would not shy away from using this community for that purpose. Not saying all of them are doing this, but some are.

There's been a few post in the past that speak of only LRC gains and trying to attach its gains to GME saying it will moon together, when the ROI would be vastly different. Recent example is the wallet, no one asked to learn how to create one step by step, and it is currently in no way related to GME. It requires a purchase of 50 LRC, which will drive demand and pump the coin. Not saying the OP who post it has malicious intent, but it is not related to GME and fuel for ""bros"" to try and get it pumped. IIRC, some comments under it was promoting it in attempts to cause fomo. If a wallet was required, then GME will state it themselves or provide it; there's no reason for us to buy in for speculation.",1640237019,hpne32u

"You’re using that loopring io desktop app?

That means your L2 is a smart contract on the loopring DEX with your metamask.

If you click on L2 wallet in the app, can you see the things you sent to the exchange?

If you have assets in that L2 but you want them in a CF wallet, you can simply transfer them to the CF wallet. Kind of acting like your own friend sending the 50 LRC.",1640229836,hpn4n4c
"LRC is just another way hedgies found to reduce retail pressure, same as with SLGG

Pump it real hard, push the idea that it's valuable, wait for apes to go in, then strangle the price slowly.",1640229251,hpn3gs9
"Somewhat serious question- why is anyone here spending money on LRC, when they could put that cash toward GME? Never really understood it",1640225767,hpmwarg
Hopefully we’ll get some LRC as well 🤤,1640225227,hpmv69v

Why is such concrete evidence of breakthrough tech being ignored/censored/oppressed??  Intelligent crypto enthusiasts are fascinated and excited by the tech..  more importantly, the potential freedom decentralized finance could provide to avg joe..      and WE GET CALLED A SHITCOIN THE SAME FUCKING WEEK 🐕 COIN &amp; Shiba ARE BLASTED EVERYWHERE CUZ THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIENT??

"Noone ""made up"" the hype around a partnership, there was and is clear evidence linking the two together. There is a reason the loopring source code is open for everyone to see; they can hold off on an official announcement while still keeping investors who are paying attention in the loop. I appreciate trying to keep hype in check, but imo a LRC partnership is all but guaranteed, we're just waiting for the official word",1640224676,hpmu0g5

"Hey thanks for asking! Well at first I was following instructions and it asked for LRC to be paid in to set it up (giving me 24 hours). I almost did that, but then I saw I was in level 1 and I think I should be doing level 2 setup?? So I clicked”setup” to the right of the level 2 button and it just started spinning. And never stopped. So now I have a countdown time left of a few hours to setup the other one (L1)but don’t know if that’s even the right area to be working with.

GameStop is easy to understand. LRC not so much - so they rely on the pathos of the echo chamber.

That said I highly suggest THROUGHLY research Loopring’s politics before giving them your money.

Amongst other things the entire float of LRC was minted shortly BEFORE the October run up to $2. Meaning it’s &gt;90% original developer controlled. If you buy now the only ones selling it to you are the developers. Buyer beware.",1640218377,hpmgskl

I have respect for what you mods do, in the sense that it's not a paid job, but I don't have respect for the way you have handled the issue, and I find it interesting that you guys are blaming GME holders for LRC holders wanting to have a conversation about L2 growth in the ETH space. 

If there were just as many posts about MATIC (which there have been in the past, no doubt), you would leave them all, since MATIC isn't owned by apes, therefore, it's not brigading.

"I always said The smartest move for GameStop when making a public announcement of future endeavors to be done on a Saturday or a long weekend. Even before LRC was in the picture I had this belief…… by announcing on a Saturday it gives more control to the peoples opinion throughout social media before half the population is pre brainwashed to even create an opinion of their own of whatever the announcement might be.

Of course I know there are plenty of fud spewing shills across social media however I still feel like it gives The audience better odds of creating their own opinion….. the majority of the msm Are not as available on weekends and holidays as they are throughout the week days",1640212690,hpm48ht

"Easy. LRC becomes irrelevant to whatever GME is planning.

If they're only using Looprings network, why would users need a shitton of LRC?

Also, if BTC drops from it's high, it'll take LRC down with it. That's pretty much the nature of crypto.

I think you're throwing alot of assumptions out to confirm your bias. I don't really want to argue with you on if you're right, (You could be) I was simply asking what rumours made you think this would 5x.

DIDNT EVEN PEEP THE LRC NEWS ON WEBULL GME PAGE LOL,1635794336,hix36t1
"Why do you feel the need to add another LRC post the pile?  
It's obviously not for the karma",1635794119,hix2nrn
GME hit over $200. Why not post about that? LRC guys trying to pump their own investment now.,1635794099,hix2m0b
"Sometimes I wish this sub was even remotely open to the idea of using leftover funds for supplementary investments lol. I'm way the fuck up on lrc in the last couple weeks. But I get it I suppose, people come here for GME information thats it",1635793756,hix1s3u
"&gt;If it was the culture of this sub to believe only information officially confirmed by institutions, we would have left when the official SI% decreased.

I think you know that OP's post isn't about only trusting official news from institutions.

Discussing how Loopring and GameStop might be collaborating is one thing, pumping LRC is an entirely different issue. No specific crypto currency should be being discussed on this sub. Discussions about blockchain on the other hand... LFG!",1635793718,hix1otv
"Don't you think you're being a little reductive here? The problem is that LRC is getting a lot of discussion around here because of the probable Loopring GME partnership. 

The one absolute core tenet of this sub has always been ""GME only"". It's a slippery slope is all I'm saying.",1635792772,hiwzeni
"Hi. OP of the one at the bottom here.

I've seen too many comments talking about where LRC is at right now, and that's the kind of thing we call **shilling.**

Stop calling everything a campaign when we're trying to *stop* one from happening.

Don't let people pump crypt0 on Superstonk, that's not why it was created.",1635792498,hiwyqez
"Damn right on all counts. 

I wish the best for LRC but it's not related.

From what I've seen, the coin isn't even related to the L2 marketplace which will be build on E TH anyway. Great to see our (potential) partner doing well but gotta keep eyes on the prize. GME is my one and only.",1635792450,hiwym8d
"Yes but I think that will happen in the backend and in the marketplace there will be a GME branded coin. Jusy my thoughts on it, I don't know enough about how it will be built to say anything for certain. There is definitely going to be huge value in LRC though even if it's not the main coin used in the marketplace",1635792417,hiwyjd7
"THIS GUY SLAYS

Anti- LRC posts seem shilly OR in need of a re-read on the DD",1635792288,hiwy7zi
"I wouldn’t say it’s a distraction, if you can put 10$ in and get 10 LRC coins, it could end up being a decent play with next to no risk.

For example when I saw the list of PCO’d stocks, I picked up 1 or 2 of some of them.

It’s not a distraction to be informed.",1635792108,hiwxs4f
"Loopring (LRC) is going off!

Over a dollar now.",1635792092,hiwxqmo
"Because half the mentions of Loopring are discussing LRC, quickly followed by someone saying, ""yeah I'm throwing some money at it""",1635792045,hiwxmb0
"I mean literally 90% of the hype here is speculation lol. We have our solid foundation DD, which is all that matters, and through our hive mind we've been able to piece together patterns from RC, DFV and GS posts. But if you wanna shut the Loopring/NFT theory down you better support shutting down every other TinFoil/speculation post on here too, including Wu-Tang. 

For the record, I have literally a total of 67 LRC that I don't plan on selling lmao. It was from other leftover holdings I had back in Feb that would have cost more to transfer out, so I exchanged last week. I'm not shilling it, I'm just pointing out that DD from here has given us very, very strong reason to believe that we will be getting an announcement soon, and that the LRC connection is at the very least contributing to some of GME's price movement today.",1635792000,hiwxi98
"You will be chasing after confirmation. LRC is cheep, can literally turn lunch money in to lambos. It’s a good GME side dish.",1635791840,hiwx4bq
I swapped half my ADA for LRC yesterday! 👍😎 Wish I swapped it all! 🤣,1635791566,hiwwggm
"This is the only thing that people are using to defend pushing LRC on Superstonk right now. A GitHub commit leaked some variable names that mention GameStop directly, which is reason to believe they're a confirmed partnership. However, GameStop has said nothing officially, and there's still no reason to push their coin here.",1635791538,hiwwdys
I gave you an updoot but I will not lie. . . I believe GME is the only MOASS . . . But if rumor of NFT with LRC is true. . . Hmm..  . . So I got 420 of LRC back when it was about .56 for fuck it sake. . . Buying more GME and DRS more batches of shares and holding that little bit. . . See what happens,1635791495,hiwwaa2

"Yeah—LRC is a very cool and possibly revolutionary project but if you didn’t buy based on the merits of it alone a while back, and you want to buy NOW because of GME, you might as well spend it on GME in my thinking. Fuckery abounds in the equities markets, and doubly so in crypto. If someone had already invested in LRC, this is a very cool development, but GME is still the real play IMO.",1635791133,hiwvej3
"LRC is directly related to GME. They are going up because of news of the partnership, it's in all the headlines about LRC blowing up. Hell that could be part of why GME is going up today too. It's bullish, it's good news, and it's supporting months of DD.

As long as no one is saying to sell GME for LRC, it's not a bad thing to talk about the fact that the company facilitating GS NFTs is making gains too. A lot of people still have some money in crypto left over. Why wouldn't they use some of that to support the company that will likely have a full announcement with GS in the very near future, or at least be excited about it?

"This sub really doesn’t get crypto. This isn’t a stock. There was hardly any liquidity on the Coinbase orderbooks so when it broke through resistance, price had to increase quickly to find orders that it could fill. It’s really not that complicated. Same reason a shitcoin can be created and have “millions in volume” despite very few funds flowing into it. It’s all about the circulating supply combined with the liquidity on the order books. This sub is too used to the liquidity of the NYSE and thinks this sub can’t pump a low liquidity coin? I have seen pump groups on telegram pump things higher with 6x less members than this sub. You are kidding yourself if you think the hive mind of the sub, all buying LRC on exchanges with low liquidity in the books can’t manipulate price. 

Crypto and stocks are two different ball games. Explain to me how buying LRC even helps? You need ETH to send LRC because LRC is a ERC-20 token… that means LRCs own contract runs on ethereum and needs ETH to pay transaction fees. Try sending a LRC transaction from Coinbase. It’s $15-$30 depending on how busy the network is. So to spend $15 in LRC you have to spend another $15 just to transact it.

That’s not to say loopring might not be involved in future GameStop plans, but just buying lrc won’t help anything. I mean half this sub thinks the LRC sent to GameStop’s single nft contract means anything.. that contract can’t even use LRC let alone even register it has been sent LRC. The current GameStop nft contract everyone is freaking out about only registers and uses ETH.

I am a crypto dev and a gme holder, why in the world would you all attack me for telling you the truth? If you want to by smart contract tokens you don’t understand, that’s on you. I can’t see how you all preach buying gme and nothing else but have now lost your mind over a small cap player in the crypto space. This sub is wild.",1635787900,hiwnj7g

Amazing how vast this new Web3/ L2 environment will be. So many different key players for major adoption.

"I hear ya and have followed this closely (I invested in tZero prior to Overstock squeeze, wrote a post on the PACER court docket).

I can’t imagine that RC &amp; team would approach this with anything but 1000% compliance with any regulatory issues. They’d be dead in the water to approach it otherwise, as all it would take is a securities lawyer showing NFT’s in many instances would fail (pass?) the Howey test and be classified as a security. GG already said publicly that he considers e-th to be a security. If GME wasn’t pivoting the entire corporate strategy around this they could just list a dividend on tZero just like OSTKO was done. They’d have the legal precedent and compliance all taken care of (for pennies basically).

So they’re obviously going bigger than just the dividend, and that alone already requires regulatory approval. So why would they ever try to operate in a regulatory vacuum— especially since they’re publicly traded and liable from a fiduciary standpoint if they try to skirt regulations?

So if I had to guess I’d think they see what tZero built and are like “that’s cool, let’s build our own exchange that has more liquidity and is cheaper &amp; easier thanks to LRC”. That’s just the start though, as the NFT marketplace and potential applications will be massive. That code won’t be built without high level regulatory involvement, they’d be crazy to do it any other way.

Btw, there have been interesting developments in tZero’s JV with BSTX. Regrettably BSTX’s subsidiaries have Shitadel on the cap table. So Kenny must know this shit is coming. I just don’t know why he’s still playing dumb to it. I don’t trust that snake",1638764397,hnf4yqn

Well if that’s not screaming LRC partnership idk what does…",1638759340,hneu2s0
Fuck me. Do I have more money in my savings account now? All is in lrc and gme,1638758495,hnes7r2
Was any of the other original gme/lrc GitHub info just copy/pasted from open source as well?,1638757292,hnepj82
It’s a software protocol that operates on ethereum. I guess if ETH goes down so does LRC but that’s why I’m asking,1638756452,hnennpq
Gme and lrc🚀🚀🚀,1638756251,hnen7p4
isn’t LRC etherium? Fuck I’m retarded so idk what i’m talking about,1638756052,hnemrvz
Same. For I second I thought maybe LRC…but GME isn’t backed by it. Just future marketplace partners. What’s the GME backed crypto?,1638756050,hnemrp9
I wonder if homie means lrc. I've been simultaneously siphoning money into that project as well weekly.  Only because of affiliation with gme.,1638755847,hnembnm
Websites that also want to leverage loop rings platform like if Deviant Art wanted to sell NFTs with the L2 that loop rings built need to hold 250k LRC minimum iirc,1638755558,hnelolg
Is he potentially relating to LRC when talking about crypto? 🤷🏻‍♂️ Just asking. No wrinkles here,1638755387,hnela8m
"Is he talking about ETH and LRC? That's what popped into my head. I have to admit that whole thing sounded like an ad and I'm certainly not putting any money into anything other than GME at the moment, but there will have to be other places to put my money after MOASS. Blockchain gold doesn't sound like a horrible idea.",1638755329,hnel5db
Two weeks ago I Liquidated everything (stocks and crypto) except GME and LRC. Cash is ready if they try to push GME further down.  This shot is about to get wild. LFG.,1638754843,hnek2gm
Im saying before Christmas. People typically have money before Christmas.....a great time to invest in GME and/or LRC (Not that there's a bad time to invest in either one),1638753569,hneh68o

"I dont think that's true, last time they announced their new fulfilment centre 

I'm staying jacked, after this week theres only really 1 more good week before people are busy with christmas and lrc said their announcement is q4",1638751908,hnedg4w
"You can trade USDT in the app at least - I just checked.

Regardless, I meant that they could decide not to accept Tether in the exchange and whatnot being built on top of LRC.",1638750950,hneb6za

"&gt;  I wouldn't want to launch it knowing what's coming. I would wait until it all crashes and then ride the rebound.

The thing is if it's running off of LRC who are completing their own L2 wallets you could directly spend fiat and buy LRC while skipping BTC/USDT. This is the beginning of the future.",1638749540,hne7w7p
I bought LRC at .38c hire me I'm ahead of the game,1638748886,hne6c2k
"Maybe.

My personal opinion is that ethereum needs both 2.0 and roll ups to become wildly undervalued. That combo, If delivered without safety compromise, would be a game changer imo because it unlocks extreme efficiencies.

And then a bunch of competitive companies need to somehow co-exist in that space.

Fwiw I do not hold any ethereum and I hold a negligible amount of LRC and hundreds of thousands of dollars of Gme.",1638747758,hne3lu4
"I know it's usually a stupid idea, but I will sell my lrc for a but of a loss right now and wait for the dip on the crypto market to buy back in, will tell you how much I regret that choice in about 3 days",1638747704,hne3h2a
"Not going to give financial advice, but I have purchased it, and I believe it will be especially useful, and do not plan to sell the vast majority of it.

The way I see it, USDT is the grease that helps get people into creep toe, helping speed up transactions between buying and selling creep toe with fiat. The limiting factor was really txn times, especially with online banking. It takes days for your purchase to make it through the bank, then to get the money on exchange, and finally to purchase creep toe. USDT essentially was created to avoid that situation, and made it easier to day trade, essentially as an in-between for fiat and creep toe. 

I think L2 is going to solve a lot of these problems with it's efficiency. I also believe we will shift away fiat once the masses see how much of a lie it is. To me, the $USD value of LRC is irrelevant. I think it is going to invaluable, especially if there is mass adoption with L2, especially if companies start trading their shares as NFTs and DAOs on L2 de-fi exchanges. LRC is the currency you use in order to make txns on L2.

Not financial advice, but you do the math.",1638747649,hne3c41
"Usdt is tether, I don’t buy any of the stable coins I’m looking for gains I hold Algorand Lrc crypto.com they all seem legit and algorand gives you 6%apy just for holding it",1638745358,hndxpw1
"Right because people were *withdrawing* them (basically DRSing them). Not necessarily to satisfy the trade volume. We don’t know how many LRC are currently held by coinbase customers do we?

They seem to be playing internalization games just like Citadel, which IIRC happens to be a board member. Things that make you go hmmm, right?",1638743316,hndsma2

I believe it's so they can pull in the LRC  API for the exchange",1638742857,hndrgpy
I honestly figured it'd be as easy as tracing their wallets on etherscan/bscscan etc to look at holdings. Coinbase ran out of LRC recently.,1638742714,hndr3gs
I prefer the rollercoaster that is being a GME &amp; LRC holder. Double the rollercoaster. Double the fun,1638742687,hndr0yv
"So....keep lrc, right?",1638742500,hndqjk6
"Iirc LRC is a token which is used to pay for transaction fees on L2, and as such is deflationary. When you transact on L2, it burns LRC. So LRC is essentially needed to provide liquidity.",1638741845,hndou01
I must have misunderstood where the LRC connection is here? (In your title),1638740809,hndm435
Dammit.  I spent a couple of Starbucks coffee worth on LRC!  I could have spent it on and consumed those horrible beverages and have already forgotten what flavor they were!!!,1638740476,hndl8nu
Maybe he heard about the LRC/GME partnership and wants to try to beat RC to the punch but he knows he's way behind... 🤷🏼‍♂️,1638740053,hndk4o5

"Noooooo, I fell for the LRC meme. FML",1638737524,hnddbb5
That would also explain that some people speculate on LRC being an utility token rather than an crypto asset no?,1638737067,hndc2ib

Why isn’t Finestone developing gamestops own Defi crypto based off the same principles of LRC that he knows?",1638732187,hncy849
"For sure. I usually don't talk other investments here, since this is GME Town, but I'll say that I have a relatively small amount of LRC ""just in case"" and have kicked myself for missing some of the dips and the chance to average down.

Just gotta stay vigilant.",1638721645,hnc6tx4

"Yes it's negative towards the media , that's its intent



The media have had 12 months to put out positive articles on GameStop GME  , yet the didn't 


The media only reported when GME was going down despite the February and March run ups...why ?

My belief in Ryan Cohen and Matt Finestone goes all the way back to them knowing each other since the Lives in Canada,  Facts Matt Finestone helped build  LRC back in 2018and there is a great chance that they will partner with GME.......do you see it now.......Ryan's Cohen has been silently chipping away at this  for a number of years.....I've done my homework and I still don't know how big this is..




You u/radio9988 feel free to go to the media and tell them your story...its your life do what you want with it...based on your comment your not part of  GME rather your a plant stationed here to instill doubt and make investors question  their reasons for investing in GME.




GameStop is bigger than you will ever know.....Ryan Cohen is a 4D chess player",1638716863,hnbvtyk
"My thesis is that GME is undergoing a transformative change. Gaming always leads innovation. eCommerce, metaverse, digital assets, blockchain gaming, AR/VR 2030, all of these themes put GME at the center of the future economy- so I have a BIG position.

In getting them there there are going to be many partnerships. They'll likely do things in entertainment, esports, hardware (they are going to build something to compete with Quest), block chain tech etc. I've researched Looprings DEX and Smart Wallet tech and it's superior to CEXs in every way. In the future you hold your assets in a trustless wallet and trade P2p, no central party. These digital assets include everything from NFTS to crypto tokens. These assets can be issued by IP owners, minted by players, traded, collected, brought in game. The L2 gasless minting with FIAT onramping of Loopring (launching now) enables all of this. A huge onboarding of millions of potential players into the digital ecosystem.

GME is significantly manipulated and stuck in the incumbent legacy system. One way they break out is by leaving legacy finance and re-listing in de-fi as a p2p tradable token. No reason why GME can't have an ICO. That token would trade using the Loopring protocol because it's there, it's ready, it's a means of trading. Loopring may be irrelevant in 2 years, the space is moving fast, but they check all the boxes for fulfilling a lot of short and medium term goals of GME. GME can obviously also remain principally listed on NYSE but also issue a crypto token that has some portion of ownership which would trade de-fi. Overstock already did this but they weren't really the right business. Gaming is. 

The crypto token could also be issued as reward points from ecom and retail purchases, giving consumers actual tokens that represent real utility in the business. The community would own GME. Also that token will be the currency of the NFT marketplace. It's an entire ecosystem built around that.

You have to really research DEX technology and ring liquidity. It's complicated stuff and would take years for GME to build on their own. They don't need to. The tools are all there. 

If you develop a comphrensive theis on what GME is doing and where they are going you'll see this protocol for what it is- a useful tool. I also think that when we see the NFT announcement GME might go up 20-50% stock price, but the LRC coin will go up 300-400%. Not to mention L2s are entering a hype stage. Take those profits, buy more GME.

I will, after using my brain, be able to buy way more GME, than by just discounting a part of the picture because shills and anti-china.",1638716245,hnbuk9h
"I think most people who read our conversations will see the logic of my argument, especially after all this time of us being beset by bad faith actors trying to make us believes things to make us divest from GME, either by hedge funds who want to reduce the pressure on their bad bets, or by the selfish interests of those who want to ride the coattail of GME, or both.

So what's your thesis? If we mention that there is a tiger at the marketplace three times that makes a tiger appear?

My money is in GME, a tangible, international company flushhhhh with cash, zero debt, poised to go through an incredible transformation, with at the head a dream team of managers, VPs and other directors, who were part of companies valued hundreds of times what GME is valued right now.

And on your side.......

Rumours and ""substantial hints"", Discord screen grabs, Twitter follows, and ALLLLLLLLLL of it coming from greedy Loopring's side/LRC holders who see a chance to get their fucking coin to pump.",1638715718,hnbth0l
"? 

My thesis is that GameStop has nothing to do with LRC, and that fraudulent claims are being made so as to pump that coin.

GameStop is only extremely tangentially linked to Loopring through Matt Finestone, who had worked there for three years. 

Market does its own thing in this clown world.

Do you know what sub you are on?",1638711372,hnbleex
"I ain't putting money anywhere close to LRC.

The absence of rebuttal of a pump does not mean the acceptance of it. If GameStop started refuting all the rumours Satan's little helpers (read: shills and marketers), there would be no end to it.

My money is going to GameStop. That's where my mouth is.

All hints come from Loopring's side or their apologists or their coin holder.

Their L2 technology is not unique

Why would GameStop have anything to do with them?",1638710764,hnbke0y
"Look, Matt Finestone would have already made a public statement if Loopring was not involved. Everyone is aware of the broad spectrum rumors. It’s even on Bloomberg. Matt represents GME but he also holds LRC still. It would be a terrible look if the rumors weren’t squashed, if they were untrue. A huge conflict of interest.

Turns out they’ve done none of that. More breadcrumbs and more indications this partnership is true.

Yes the coins have appreciated after years of trading sideways. A true undiscovered gem. 

You can take advantage of this information or be contrarian and short it. But whatever you do better put your money where your mouth is.",1638710395,hnbjruu
" Nothing to worry about, LRC devs have been pushing updates out that are now in QA phase before release meaning it's stable but needs a other pass before public push.",1638708350,hnbgp99
"Shit put him onto LRC, if he doesn’t find his way to GME from there then he really is retarded",1638707656,hnbfq85
"Look how high their coins that they hold climbed, they are rich now.

They are in continental China away from the arm of any kind of law

Thus far all I've seen is them trying to pump their coins by dropping hints the same way plsrdao and nftcon has done 

All of the LRC pumpers who come in here day in day out want out of the apes is for them to make the value of their coins go up.",1638707639,hnbfpe8
"Loopring will be on the hook to deliver to their investors, as they promised news worth 10 quarterly reports.

Trust in RC and LRC to deliver before this year ends. 

Else Loopring is fucked.",1638706410,hnbe35q
"For the MetaMask wallet it is free to set up but will cost you some fees to move your coins per transaction. The fees vary I have paid anywhere from 4-8 LRC per transaction to move from coin base pro. The Loop-ring Wallet currently has a high fee (200+) and I don’t have that wallet yet. I’m waiting for the free counterfactual wallet they are working on to drop, then I’ll be moving there.",1638706069,hnbdnjg
"It's more that someone registered mattfinestone.eth after him, and associated it with a new wallet address, which has since only *attempted* to interact with the nft teaser address by failing to send eth and lrc to it. It's no substantial interaction.

Meanwhile Matt Finestone has a proven history of owning finestone.eth and 3body.eth, and (at least with finestone.eth) had legitimate transactions with addresses that control the gnosis proxy that owns the nft teaser contract.",1638704710,hnbby9s
Just curious what you think of LRC?,1638703373,hnbabco

And please shills don’t even try the “ we’re just trying to pump your LRC” … No not at all. All I’m trying to do is remind apes to check and see the possibility available at fingertips. If LRC rises to $3.60 with a $250 investment at $2.25 you should be able to profit enough to buy one share of GMER on Monday,1638684809,hnam6v7

This still doesn't confirm anything at all lol. Maybe they invested in gamestop stock and that's it. We need solid confirmation. Anything for fucks sake. Even just tweet the damn GME logo on the LRC Twitter,1638681737,hnah2iz
"I'm no crypto/financial expert, so I honestly can't say. However, I'm confident that Loopring will survive, and not just for their association with Gamestop. Their fundamentals are sound, and the tech they've developed solves some critical issues holding back Ethereum. I believe it will drop with everything else, but I'm hanging onto mine. I went long on LRC for some of the same reasons I'm long on GME.

This is of course my opinion, and not financial advice.",1638680306,hnaegmz

So I’m pretty sure we agree. Not sure who you’re arguing with, but I haven’t seen very many people in here (if any) advocating for censoring LRC altogether.",1636692750,hkap1ma
"Got it, yeah that was obnoxious, it actually deterred me from even researching it

The mods kamra loosening and the toy drive were fucking awful

That's what made me think they were in on the LRC pump lol",1636692463,hkaohz7
"Fundamentally speaking, Loopring is a crypto, and it should (and has) move downward when Bcoin takes the real plunges. From a TA perspective, LRC is set to fall way back down because it is at the highest point of its ascending channel, and actually pierced through it. If you looking at the timing of it with Bcoin and every other major crypto, they are all at the peaks of their respective channels, and all should fall whenever it starts. There should be no exceptions for any coin during the initiation of bear season. So if you are in profit stages, I would recommend taking at least some, if not all, around this level, to hedge some more. Good luck, though.",1636692403,hkaodji

Right? Now imagine how many GME shares people could buy with the retarded gains from LRC had people just listened/discussed a couple weeks back instead of cry about content on the sub.,1636692166,hkanxh6
GME + LRC = 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🍦,1636691981,hkankt2
"This is also a likely factor, and they're not mutually exclusive factors.  LRC is making big waves from what I've heard in the Crypt 'O communities, and there's definitely a lot of FOMO buying going on there.",1636690235,hkak4jg
"For your L2 wallet it still needs to be linked to an L1 one.

So you can pay to make an L1 wallet yourself.

Or if you have a freind with an LRC address they can send you a referal code and you can get the L2 one for free.

I imagine that the Freind for most people will be GameStop once they lauchn their own branded L2 app.  The loopring app is not going to be the primary means of mass adoption. I see it as a staging app for other companies to Skin and use the Loopring functionality on their own branded apps.",1640684285,hq9dlis
"Bro I've thrown about $150 at trying to buy some lrc. First I bought some Eth - about half what I spent went in a gas fee. Then I realised there was no way to just simply trade that Eth for lrc in my wallet (did NOT do enough reading).

Then recently I got the loopring app - bought the exact amount of Eth they said was needed to open my L2 loopring wallet. And then tried to convert that Eth in my wallet to lrc - turns out the price changed enough in those few seconds to mean the amount I put in is below the minimum allowed to convert. And I can't just too it up, or transfer from my original metamask wallet that has some Eth in it, I've got to basically buy the same again in my loopring L2 wallet.

So I'm stuck right now with tiny amounts of Eth and no loopring, and it doesn't look like I'll be able to throw any more at it for the next few weeks.

I thought I'd write that out so that any ape thinking about just dabbling and buying a tiny amount of lrc knows that it's not actually quite difficult.",1640683577,hq9cqoj
Of course nft marketplace drops and massive eth and lrc drop,1640683490,hq9cmzn

Hi OP. I dont know shit about jack but i looked through your post history and dont think youre a shill. Why do you think LRC is a PnD?,1640668220,hq8qzqn

I would like that sub 2.00 lrc please,1640667907,hq8qf7l
"Yeah, I completely appreciate that perspective. I do think money can be made in LRC short-term (FOMO when the announcement goes up) and long-term (I think the project has legs), but it's a different fish entirely to GME and investing in GME is obviously never a bad call in my opinion or I wouldn't be here lol.",1640667284,hq8p9rn
Heavily into both GME and LRC,1640667207,hq8p4q6
"Adding to my above comment, since LRC price cannot be rigged, retail investors cannot enter into the LRC market without significantly moving the market. Basically it's some sort of a zero-sum game until Loopring starts making money through their services. On the other hand, thanks to SHFs, no matter how many GME shares retail buys, the price is pegged under 250 bucks per share. So, retail always wins in this case.",1640667115,hq8oygd
LRC is all you need to know about crypto. And the buy button.,1640666933,hq8om3h

"Totally understandable. I'm in LRC because I initially wanted to make a quick buck for more GME but then the announcement never happened and I just got caught up in the interest of it, lol. I'm small beans, so it's nice to hold a ""large"" amount of LRC compared to GME for the price, but I completely understand someone wanting to save every penny for their GME holding. Thanks for commenting anyway!",1640666687,hq8o52q
"Yup I’m in both, even the other subs are talking about LRC might be the play of year in 2022 as far as crypto goes.",1640666513,hq8nszf
Would also hole LRC if it weren't for 2 things. 1. All my money is in gme. 2. I'm sure lrc is going to pop off after an announcement but I know gme is the 1 true stonk and they will shut off the buy button again. I don't want to be left behind at all.,1640666377,hq8njj7
Time to buy LRC....,1640665684,hq8m6ef
"You can keep multiple copies of things, I think, or at least multiple *accesses*. And you can spread your stash among different wallets: cold (offline) and hot (online) storage, more than one of each kind. The official Loop wallet is linked to a device and phone/email, so if you have more than one phone I guess you can have more than one wallet with them.  

The wallets have two ""levels"" L1 and L2, and creating the L2 wallet is free (though there is a minimum deposit required) and pretty easy to fund with a bank account or card. The L1 wallet is costly to create and operate, because of the ""gas charges"" associated with ETH transactions, and the cost is only ever estimated beforehand and can vary wildly. Unless you're wise about crypto, it's a real pain in the ass, haha. L2 is pretty sweet to use, though, and LRC has a nice dip today which I've benefited from.  

In terms of hardware, I think the wallet USBs are more secure than your standard one you pick up from Amazon in that regard. The only brand I know about is Ledger, if you want to read up about it, but I know there are also others. 

Unfortunately I am very new to this and don't know a whole ton myself! But people have been very helpful as I learn. The only real caveat I would say is do not take advice from anyone in DM, do not click or scan anything unless you know what it is and what it does, and watch out for scammers because there are so so many.",1640665568,hq8lxzr
"Funny how the crypto begins to dump all at the same time. How is it that eth, BTC, lrc and all of these others simultaneously just take a shit...oooohhhh maybe it's the meta verse.....🤔",1640665453,hq8lpnp
"More like:

"Same boat. I don't want to cash out my LRC, though I will probably sell off some of what's in my Revolut wallet. I wanted to transfer out of it and couldn't, so I re-bought in the Loop wallet and will need to get some funds back at some point.",1640664924,hq8kmsc
"Holy shit, what a nightmare! That's terrible, I am so sorry you experienced that. I can't believe that... I mean, I can, but it's horrible.

However, I will say that in this case, your bad experience was not with *crypto* as much as it was with *centeralised exchanges*. You can hold your coins yourself (like on a USB stick cold wallet thing) or even in an app, and then you cannot have them locked away from you. With LRC, you can store them in the app or a wallet of your choosing, and that can't ever happen again. You can also buy them directly from your cc or bank account, which I find really useful because I'm a coin novice and don't have an account on any of the exchanges. (I have never trusted them, and that was before I read your story!)

Not financial advice, but I do think crypto and decentralised finance will play a big role in the future, so it's something worth looking into. If you can hold your coins off exchanges, there are plenty of other concerns, but at least you won't have to go through the same bad experience again. If you're interested, the LOOPRINGORG sub has a lot of useful information and helpful people!

That said, focusing on GME is a valid strategy also. I'm just putting a little into LRC these days because I feel it's not a ""competition"" for GME and they will help each other grow.",1640664345,hq8jf27
Is LRC smart wallet a Ethereum address that can be used?,1640664257,hq8j89z
"I think 99.9% of crypto is finding the path for btc to eventually take. It’s like people forget that it has the largest amount of support and it can be hardforked to match any clearly dominant protocol. Regardless, it will remain as at least the backer of any other blockchain. So that’s where I keep my crypto money. 

Definitely waves to ride in the process but I’m not really worried about gambling/trading with other coins.

I would probably be at least 50/50 matic/lrc if I had anything specifically invested towards eth L2 development since I don’t know much about them. It seems like a fad to be honest. You don’t need a token to develop good L2 solutions, but they seem like important stepping stones right now.",1640664136,hq8iyys
"You're not wrong, but I don't think that's as relevant and problematic as it is in the stock and especially with GME. I don't think people day trading LRC screws it up the way it does with stocks because the blockchain is more transparent and less manipulated, but maybe that is my ignorance talking, lol.",1640663968,hq8imef
"I have LRC, not much though",1640663968,hq8imcy
That's how I got the 11. I used to convert my earnings to BTC and xfer out but have been doing LRC recently. Can't wait for the next lesson to drop to get me another $3 worth of LRC,1640663873,hq8if93

I found it on here at .55 grabbed a bag and 8x at one point. I don't understand why the ppl I follow like JRNY, Elio, becker etc haven't mentioned lrc or gme nfts once?!?! Like it should be screamed from rooftops..

Lopper reporting here. 90% LRC 10% GME,1640663651,hq8hydq
Have no idea how to buy LRC. all my money is in GME. Have not had good experience with CRYYPTO. 3 years ago I spent $1800 on various coins on Binance and let them ride. Checked on the investment few months ago and my account was locked. Took me many hours and way to much personal information to go through identification verification and when I finally got in and found my investment had almost double I then was told I could NOT have the money because Binance no longer served American Citizens. Tried ticket after ticket. had to do videos explaining everything and end result is they STOLE MY MONEY. Not my kind of investment. you invest now they change the rules and your shit out of luck,1640663636,hq8hxan
That means 77 million transactions which is a tall order even LRC and the new L2 process.  It means setting up potentially millions of new addresses and having them linked to the correct shareholders....  it's not an easy undertaking.,1640663629,hq8hwq7
XXxX of LRC.,1640663573,hq8hsfo
"I’m in both. I’m not sure about the ‘cash out’, because LRC seems to be a good longterm hold. GME isn’t the only big partnership that may be on the horizon.

I believe there is a partnership, but even without, it’s a solid project. That said, I’d lose some faith in Daniel Wang if nothing materializes, he did drop some hints about some news, hard, and some info is merited.",1640663522,hq8hogp

"I was under the assumption you were still using coinbase. 

as for how it works. fuck if I know but they give you like 2 to 3 dollars worth of free coins for a test you literally can't fail. 

once you have those coins you click on them and transfer them into LRC. got about 20 free coins doing this",1640663139,hq8gv67
"IMO, coin stuff is different to the stock stuff. Putting money into LRC isn't competing with GME. And while the partnership isn't *guaranteed*, it is looking more and more likely every day as new information is released to support it, today's nft.gamestop.com stuff being the biggest ""clue"" yet. 

I feel like supporting LRC is supporting GME, and that when the partnership is announced, people who bought beforehand can make a nice profit if they want to cash out, a lot of which will be used to buy more GME. 

I'm not trying to be divisive, I just am interested to see where people are standing on this currently. But I'm sure there are people here who aren't interested in LRC, and that's fine too.",1640663119,hq8gtp1

###### GME ~148.3100:🚀[MOAR DRSBOT:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qap4je/drsbot_4x_now_online/)🚀",1640649505,hq7mpav
"Uh…what if games are the Trojan horse needed to overhaul the entire structure of the global financial system? Proof of concept, if you will. DRS’d GME &amp; LRC are the way.",1635708689,hisssmq
"Crypto.com should be one of the main places to buy your crypto. CB is too outrageous on fees for both buying and selling crypto. Looking at you post history, you seem to know an okay amount on crypto. But recommending CB is not the route and especially not UniSwap who goes off ETH and their gas fees. That’s just terrible information to begin with. 

Secondly, you’re way over-hyping the potential price-tag of LRC. LRC would have to have a Market Cap of SOL or DOT to reach your price evaluation. Could it get there? Most certainly. But you need to look at Market Cap, Volume and so on in order to come up with those numbers. LRC is sitting below a $1 billion market cap, which is great potential, but a lot of things will have to happen in order for it to see these style of gains.

So to any “new users” in Crypto. I strongly advise against CB and to focus on the likes of Crypto.com.",1635708369,hiss0qv
Totally agree the blurb about LRC going to $30-50 is pumping and does not belong here.,1635708200,hisrlwn
"I understand all of that. I'm just agreeing with Tim that there's no need to discuss price predictions on LRC here. Despite all the likelihood of both companies working together, we still have no definitive statement from either of it being so. 

So for OP to say  
&gt; ""Of course, these are my thoughts and make sure you DYOR. I think Loopring will rise anyway. It’s all time high was over $2.40, and is currently sitting at $0.56. With GME and if the partnership is confirmed, I believe it could rocket to a top 10 cryptocurrency coin between $30-$50+ a coin or even higher, which is why I hold Loopring (LRC). I believe it’s going to rocket up in value, and if GME does partner with them, it’s going to moon hard!"" 

makes this post feel like an old school DubbleUSB pump.",1635708175,hisrjmk
I've been speculating on this as well.  I actually rode shib's wave to a nice tidy profit that I rolled into LRC.,1635708113,hisre67
"So we are pumping crypto and distracting from buying gme and drsing? 
I hold lrc but this is not the sub for it.",1635707954,hisr0m0
"Heavily invested in GME XXX HODLER , 


However on my crypto investments I have recently been pouring my funds into LRC it’s the future especially partnership with GME! (Currently have bit and eth, now LRC)",1635707888,hisquv7
"Could you please explain the utility that a specific CC serves relative to a platform? Such as whether LRC is necessary, or if E.TH is/could have been exchanged in the loopring? Are all these developers competing to have THE superior and dominant CC, say 10 years from now?

Coming from a background of Austrian economics, I have been waiting for someone to offer an explanation of how crptos present monetary viability. For now, they are dollar derivatives. That presents a pretty big problem to defi, but very few people, in any arena, want to address the dollar's non-moneyness.",1635707854,hisqrxg
The Loopring token (LRC) is used to cover fees for transactions. When GameStop launch their marketplace it’s possible/likely that LRC will be needed to transact. It’s education about something that is directly related to GameStop.,1635707756,hisqjpo
Because GME and LRC are (likely) partners. What’s good for one is good for the other. 🦍 strong together,1635707477,hispuvu
Shocked LRC isn’t already at $10 based on speculation alone. Fill your bags at these levels while you can. It’s going to 🚀 very very soon. 🦍,1635707439,hisprrc
LRC is hovering around .55 a coin. Just saying.,1635706659,hisnvrx
I just went into my coinbase account and bought a little more LRC.  :-),1635702863,hiseqqd
"From my quick read over on kraken about what loopring does, it helps facilitates trades and a marketplace. Helping to handle transactions. If an exchange is used, the operator needs to hold 250k loopring coins. This is just my interpretation and I could be wrong. Smoothest brain here.

From Kraken's website  
Why Does LRC Have Value?  
The Loopring cryptocurrency, LRC, is necessary for key operations on the protocol.   
For instance, anyone who wishes to operate a decentralized exchange on Loopring must lock up at least 250,000 LRC, which enables the operator to run an exchange that uses its on-chain data proofs. An operator must stake 1 million LRC to run an exchange without this feature.",1635458320,hifqgkf
"Idk how much you know about Loopring, or where you live, but it's an Ethereum based cryptocurrency that has a circulating supply of 1.3B and $745M market cap. You can buy it on any major crypto exchange like Coinbase, kraken, or Gemini depending where you live. For example, I live in New York and cannot use Kraken or Binance so I have accounts with Gemini and Coinbase, and own $LRC with both",1635457952,hifpmty
I made a post about buying LRC a month ago on jungle. It got massively down voted. Who's laughing now?,1635457923,hifpkb7
"Hell yeah, got a shit load of GME and a couple ETH tokens, gonna grab some LRC after work for the trifecta 🚀",1635457844,hifpdkf
"Coinbase sells it, available in US and Canada

Ticker symbol LRC",1635457742,hifp4r7
I dunno what it is. It I been hodling lrc for a while. Pretty much dropped my crypto account balance into it and stopped checking 6 months ago or so…. Thanks for letting me know it’s going well haha,1635457720,hifp2xm

"&gt; Binance.US

How do you buy loopring there? I have an account.. haven't found LRC. Retard here.",1635457094,hifnm5e
Buying GME supports LRC indirectly i say stick with them. Supports the company and its employees,1635456496,hifm734
LRC = Loopring 🤦🏻,1635456307,hiflqh3
Lol what? LRC isn’t on RH. Also who the fuck even still uses RH.,1635456258,hiflmap
I just bought two fake price GME worth shares of tokens for lrc just in case.,1635456253,hifllv6
"Loopring = company

LRC = coin

""OMG, I'm up a bazillion% on LRC today"" has no bearing on any partnership. It just distracts.",1635456194,hiflgtj
"I'll say it for all the people who are probably going to downvote you and me.

If you're investing in a company who is partnering with another company, investing in that partner company is simply smart. Anyone who hears the news (when it's officially announced) will go and look at LRC. They'll probably notice it's &lt; 1$ and write it off.

I personally threw a couple hundos at it today and I'm super excited about the upcoming news regarding layer 2 and LRC.

If RC chose LRC, so should you.",1635456009,hifl0r8
"They don't have a stock ticker. Loopring is a crypto token, LRC",1635455972,hifkxil
GME is partnering with LRC. How would you like to discuss that in this forum.,1635455897,hifkr0v
Going in on LRC so I can buy more GME. Can’t turn off the buy button on crypto 😏,1635455888,hifkq75
"What do you expect the day after a gmedd post about a loopring+gme leak?

There will be a ton of chat about LRC through Q4.",1635455459,hifjozi
"I bought a good amount a couple of weeks ago and added more since and I'm up 50% on my investment haha. I'm still focused on increasing my GME position, but thought it'd be harmless to snag some LRC since it's such a low cost alt.",1635455249,hifj6vb
Motha fucka so smooth he’s trying to DRS LRC at CS,1635454906,hificeg
"The thing with LRC is that when a partnership is officially announced it’s going to MOON. While GME is going to be suppressed.  
So worth holding at least a bit in order to profit from the announcement, IMHO.",1635454873,hifi9hc
"Honestly, if you're a GME holder and you believe in this company it would be stupid not to buy at least some LRC. 

People will hear GME is partnering with LRC and go and look what LRC is all about and see it trades for under 1$ and be like, ""lol ok""",1635454654,hifhqcr
"The drop yesterday was LRC following BTC.  
The rise today is more than just LRC following BTC back up though.",1635454136,hifgfoi
How do you buy lrc??,1635454106,hifgd17
Loopring up over 40% today. The August rip i gme was preceeded by a lrc rip the day prior,1635453834,hiffp0i
Try typing LRC on search bar on Binance.,1635453828,hiffohm
"I know this is about GME, but I have sinned. I bought 2000 LRC, just because they are friends of “the stock”",1635453590,hiff2zy
"Yes it is. You can buy LRC on Coinbase.

Whether or not one should, I can’t say. But it’s there.",1635453299,hifecep
Bought eth and lrc today instead of adding more gme like normal. I have this dirty feeling I fear won't wash off,1635453046,hifdpbo
Literally was going to buy LRC weeks ago but got put off cause the token wasn't available as a trade in my currency and I couldn't be bothered to trade to usdt &gt; LRC hahah oh well just another load of gains I've missed..!,1635452714,hifcvwm
And just like that I own a few hundred LRC,1635452377,hifc1wv
"Let me see if I understand, I can trade through the app which is also my wallet, correct? So I buy eth on kraken or whatever and then transfer it to the lrc wallet, and with the wallet I can trade different coins without paying the same sorts of fees?",1635452252,hifbqnu
"Yea, I got about 1300 LRC around 6am. I checked the chart and it seems to move around big meme stock movements as well. If GME moons, LRC will too.

The real reason I bought in, was because if GME and LRC are partners, I want to do what I can to support anyone GME supports.",1635452184,hifbkji
"Well, I guess the GME token is going to be the functional currence in the NFT marketplace. Don't think that it would make sense to implement LRC there.

Once the NFT marketplace and the GME token is launched, I bet this token is going to moon as well.",1635452138,hifbgfp
"And for everyone who finds crypto purhasing too hard. Heres quick instruction how to start.

*Step 1. Register to exchange. (I use Binance but there are many other exchanges.)*

*Step 2. Fund your account with dirty FIAT (USD/EUR/etc.)*

*Step 3. Buy LRC (Loopring) or any other crypto on your exchange.*

*Step 4. Profit ???*",1635452007,hifb4kl
I heard looping LRC is working with them should we be buying LRC coin?,1635451806,hifammk
I dropped 1k on lrc and 1k on gme this morning!  Diversification lol,1635451648,hifa89z
"Loopring crypto worth about $0.50.  Just gimme 40,000,000 LRC per share and I'm set.   I know, i know... ""floor is 10 trillion""",1635451452,hif9qj9
"I see, wish someone would have said that when I asked on their sub, I would have bought some LRC.",1635450912,hif8e2w
"Loopring is an order book DEX. So operators on Loopring network will need LRC tokens to be staked. If you're a bad actor on the network then your LRC tokens will get slashed. For example, if want to open an exchange on the Loopring network you must put up a large amount of LRC tokens. If your exchange submit wrong/bad transactions onto network then your LRC tokens will get slash. There are few reasons why your tokens can slashed.",1635450025,hif66bn
I thought of it since I’ve been in crypto for a while but I just don’t have the money man… everything is in GME. I thought a while back that Loopring was an easy 100% profit short term gain but alas. I have to wait until I’m filthy rich to be able to buy LRC,1635449804,hif5meg
I had about $300 in mined ETH that I just swapped for LRC last week. The surge today *almost* got me back what I paid in gas lol,1635449699,hif5cul
"I tried creating a loopring wallet (even though gas prices are insane right now) and I think I made a big mistake. I was previously using the layer2 app with metamask and bought LRC. When I was asked to make payment I transferred from the layer2 app to the address to deposit but it doesn’t show up in etherscan. I’m now realizing I probably had to withdraw into my metamask wallet, then to the address?  I know it’s not GME but I’ve never worked with crypto before and feel like I just threw $300 into oblivion. Can anyone confirm this for me?",1635449679,hif5b3l
"Does the Ledger work for Loopring? I checked on their website for supported coins, but couldn't find LRC on it. But I am also retarded, maybe you can help me grow a wrinkle?",1635449214,hif454r
I have a really modest 26 LRC ...since this morning. Finally figured out how Krypto buying works. So proud of myself.,1635448833,hif36gf
"What does LRC have to do with that? It seems to me, and I even asked on the loopring sub a couple days ago, that their coin and their exchange technology aren't really related. If they would have used their technology to tokenize their company and done their own public offering that would be a different story.",1635448465,hif298k
"Yes it is

&gt; LRC is the Loopring protocol token, used to incentivize protocol-desirable behaviour from liquidity providers, insurers, and DAO governors. Protocol fees come from Loopring L2 economic activity, and flow into productive Loopring network participants and into LRC itself.

thanks to this sub i'm now apelike allin on LRC,1635447630,hif06co
"Here’s my point:

The better the company does (it’s stock), more people are interested in buying it (demand). The better the stock price does as a result, often helps funding for the company. They can raise more money, etc.

This future with LRC is exciting and brings Gamestop into an ecosystem that has so much potential, but they would be pioneers.",1635447191,hiez2nt
Sounds a bit shilly to pump LRC in a GME subreddit,1635446887,hieyb1x
"I've commented on it several times this last two months.

No LRC on Kraken at this time.,1635445012,hietj6h
"Bitcoin or Ether are 2 different coins based on their own blockchain. Tokens are created within a blockchain that already exist.

Bitcoin does not offer the ability to create tokens via their blockchain technology - the majority of tokens are made on the Ethereum blockchain, such as Loopring, Dog3 or Sh1b.

This is because it takes a lot of time and effort to programme and create your own blockchain and to get the network set up. So instead of going through all that time and effort to create your own digital asset, you can just make tokens on an already existing blockchain. This is something that was only really made possible by Ethereum, and is a space in crypto that they continue to lead.

Something that might help you to understand it all, is that you can only purchase ERC (ethereum-derived) tokens (such as Dog3, Sh1b, LRC/Loopring tokens, Uni tokens etc.) using Ether.

Don’t confuse Ethereum and Ether. Ethereum is the network, Ether is the cryptocoin/currency within that network - but Ethereum allows the creation of cryptokens/other currencies within that network. 99% of the time people mention tokens, they are referring to an ERC token created within the Ethereum network.

Hope this helps.",1635444883,hiet76j
"From what I’ve read the coin (LRC) is the basis for all transactions and the reward for doing good things within the communinty. You can read more [here.](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/lrc-tokenomics-v2-1e6fd99e9e9c)

I’m hoping LRC is a functional currency in the NFT marketplace.",1635443994,hieqx9c

GME worth exactly 100x LRC at one point right there.  Bullish.,1637002219,hkr32cr
"one concept, yet to be proven, can clear up a lot of these questions, which are good and inter-connected.

if the gme nft and the gme share are connected at a specific rate of value say 7 gme nft for 1 gme share, at time of writing this comment it would be: 207.46/7= $29.63

not a threatening number in of itself

29.63 in LRC is 10.15 LRC and you get the idea

now, the nft we know is based on eth blockchain, we know there gamestop nft will sell the nft, if it was a specific share holder financial vehicle then they wouldn't have put the

""power to the players

power to the creators

power to the collectors""

tag line on the website, it would have arrived to each gamestop hodler via gamestop formal financial paperwork

so we can then presume that gamestop will sell the nft on their own website, if that's the case then gamestop web app and mobile app will be a web3 wallet connected to both eth blockchain and lrc exchange, it only stands to reason. they cannot sell blockchain related nft without being connected to the blockchain.

now, if the popularity makes the nft go up $1, what happens to the share? the share goes up $7. if the nft goes up $20 the share goes up $140

the shorts will have to decide:

do we compete on an open market where we cannot use our market maker powers without a darkpool as the nft price goes up? if we contribute to the price going up we're spending more money to no end and we have to give what we buy to the people we borrowed from because we are not willing to buy back their shares in order to close our short positions. we will go bankrupt

OR

instead of competing on an open market we can start to close our short gme positions and buy back the shares we borrowed and go bankrupt

either way is bankruptcy, either way is moass, the decision is theirs, gamestop nft coming has been public news since April? the sec has published a report claiming no foul play. no matter what they do they are screwed. if you hold both gme and lrc your values go up.

moass isn't the end, it's just the beginning. once other tickers see that there is a way to stop shorts from naked shorting a stock other companies, apple, facebook amazon etc. they'll want to do it to. they can either create their own exchange etc. or they can use what works, LRC exchange and lrc smart wallet. Mainstream DeFi; it's coming get ready, buckle up",1636999363,hkqvswk

"CEX don’t immediately give you your tokens the moment you buy them. You have a REFERENCE to it. You truly own it when you actually transfer to your wallet. Let’s say Coinbase owns 100M LRC, but it’s users actually own 120M LRC, then that means there are shared instances of ownership. Until you transfer your LRC to your wallet, you don’t actually have complete ownership. So when 120M of those LRC are transferred out, Coinbase has to find a way to buy those 20M extra LRC. That will increase the price of LRC because now Coinbase is making the purchase of 20M LRC. Remember that people sell too, so the chances of Coinbase needing to purchase extra LRC gets smaller because they just need to swap the references of ownership.",1636997335,hkqqnit
"I seem to have triggered a lot of emotions with this post. Maybe it was a bad choice of title. Guess what? I got the ENS airdrop last week and **I BOUGHT LRC**. I can own LRC and think owning it doesn't help Gamestop at the same time.

Copped a bit of hate on GME about the possible links to other notable events last week also, I feel real tinfoil proposing things like this but currently finding countless fake bots and accounts on Reddit and Twitter trying to pump SDC last week right before a massive dump, CRO this week which is up 111% MTD...
Same time spreading negative sentiment about LRC.

Should be an FTD report out this week.  RC twisted jacked tits with a tweet.  Lots of call options at $200, $210, $220 and $250.  Continued anticipation of a GME/LRC/NFT announcement.  FED is signaling squeeze on QE and rising interest rates.  Probably due for another China real estate deflation headline.  If I was running the SHF psy-op, I'd drop a fake squeeze in this week on the heels of any positive announcement.  Plenty of shares available to borrow at 0.8%, and a great set-up for another FOMO trap.

Other thoughts?",1636986393,hkq0o0a
"To repost something I said, as you’ve stated change your mind. 

You do realise that LRC is nearly top trending crypto right now right? Which means LRC sub is gaining followers at an astonishing rate.
For every 1 share CURRENT holders could have bought a few extra, they bought some LRC. What does everyone that hears about LRC end up seeing? Nothing but the LRC - GME link and the amount of crypto crowd that is now buying GME far outweighs the current holders buying more GME.
The only fud is not letting this happen because the 2 are linked and by letting it run will gain much more exposure than otherwise.
Open your eyes and mind and zoom out, look at the bigger picture.
On top of that there is only 1 idiosyncratic stock, anyone that sells LRC for a profit you can be sure are gonna be buying more gme than they could have otherwise.

"[the Failure to Deliver FTDs are speculated to be in the hundreds of millions](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&amp;q=SEC+Data+Show+%24359+Million+of+GameStop+Shares+Failed+to+Deliver&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8) news of this exposure was published in Feb 2021 across multiple news outlets

it was presumed that because FTDs accrue interest that shorts would either pay the interest on FTDs or start closing out their positions

stonk-o-tracker a free independent that shows FTD interest among many other ftd related data points shows that gme ftd interest went from a typical 30-55% interest down to 1% (some sort of high level scam)

this granted the shorts time so that they would have to close their shorts immediately, meanwhile their ftds have only increased because they continue to synthesize and borrow in order to short gme down but not get to $0 which is their only target, $0 is the only acceptable victory for them.

now, if there is some other sort of 'token' that has a rate of value in relation to the gme share that can go up then the shorts are in a squeeze they cannot cheat out of. what is speculated to happen is that the gamestop NFT will be released and available for purchase but that if you have gamestop shares you'll earn gamestop nft at a specific ratio to your shares, personally, I think it'll be 7 nft 4 1 gme share, 7:1. at current market value of writing this comment that would put the gamestop nft at 202/7 = $28.85

this is not a threatening number in of itself but that fact that the nft is based on ethereum and will most likely be sold on an exchange where you have a buy a certain crypto in order to purchase means a frenzy on the nft may occur. if there is a frenzy then there can be a spike in ethereum, lrc, the presumed crypto and the nft itself.

in short, at a ratio of 7-4-1, if the nft goes up $1 the gme share goes up $7, if the nft jumps $20 the gme share jumps $140

those FTDs will approach a near callback state, people that lent their shares out will want a piece of the current action because the money now is hotter than collecting less that 0% interest.

the people that shorted and over-synthesized (market makers) gme now have a problem, do they compete to buy the nft in eth and lrc while the prices are going up in order to avoid giving back shares they borrowed and sold or do they just start buying gme shares in order to close their position while the price of gme is sub $500?

they have to try and buy the nft. here's the fun thing about the nft, it cannot be synthesized by market makers due to it being on a crypto blockchain, volume of sales cannot be disguised and wash sales are harder to conduct and hide, there's no dark pool and the crypto market never sleeps. they will not be able to buy the nft fast enough in relation to the number of shares they borrowed so while the price of the nft goes up due to popularity they'll also have to close their short positions and buy gme shares. this is where the real fun begins.

there's a billion shares they have to buyback it's gonna take forever. the longer it takes for them to buy back over 1000 million gme shares the higher the price for the shares you have. once they get you, you might not sell because you not selling makes it so that their short position never closes, they'll always owe and the price will stay high. you can borrow against the value of your gme shares (that will always need to be closed) and your nfts. 

infinite money glitch; it's their own system. they got too greedy. when some token has a value in relation to gme share become immensely popular on a blockchain that cannot be 'hacked' they'll have to buy both in order to maintain their con, when doing so becomes too expensive they die and we win.

it's 2008 but this time it's hundreds of thousands of apes around the world that are Front Point Partners or Brownville Capital or Scion Capital, just don't dance, unless you really really cannot help yourself, then dance a little.

The only fud is not letting this happen because the 2 are linked and by letting it run will gain much more exposure than otherwise.

"I dont look at lrc sub. Superstonk DD talked possible loopring partnership with my favorite company, gme. On Sept 8 I wondered ""maybe I should buy a couple shares of loopring stock... its going to be fun to watch if they do actually partner with gme""

So... didn't find a stock. Found a coin. Figured ""ok well all the people who like the loopring/gme partnership will maybe want a few lrc. I think I'll grab some for posterity. Just to say ""I was here"""". 

Bought $1000 of lrc at .45 on Sept 8. 

Ok so now it starts jumping up. Whoa. Put another $1000 there. I think I might have had a good guess. 

Looks great. That's enough. Maybe the lrc will be super fabulous in the future. 

I dont do crypto. I DO gme. I am all in. My retirement is in GME. I just dont see why I need to continuously buy more gme when they will be ""phone number prices"" in the future. I have xxx gme. I DRSd like 95% of it. I live just fine on what I earn now as a nurse and even a single share for millions would be more than enough to retire on. I dont need a trillion dollars! I dont need a hundred million! Why should I keep buying gme? I feel like I'm set. I bought lrc as an accessory to gme! I'm so tired of people saying its not gme related. I would never have known it existed if not for the (very likely) partnership posts here. 

So. If you have lrc.. its just for fun. GME is the big money play. But I think lrc _IS_ relevant. Plus, it's nice to see those numbers up 700-800%. You guys are just fucking grouchy.

LRC is LoopRing Coin. A L2 ethereum based crypto asset that is extremely fast and scalable. It's also EXTREMELY cheap as far as fees go, comparable to fees like what non-crypto users are used to. It's an amazing coin, you should check out the LRC subreddit.

But beyond that, many of us here have speculated for months that GME is about to launch a cryptocurrency based nft marketplace. There's proof everywhere you look... including *in the leaked code for lrc*. The creator of LRC was hired by GME, along with a ton of other crypto programmers for an ""unannounced crypto project"".

With all the leaks, tweets, and hints... all signs point to GME using LRC for the marketplace.

And obviously, if that happens, it'll be huge for both GME and LRC, and the squeeze, as GME will suddenly have the ability to issue a crypto based dividend. Which could trigger the squeeze, as every share would then be accounted for.

Will take the same amount of time….also, the product is only as good as its developer, and how many exceptional developers are at the DTCC or are willing to bid on their pet project.  It’ll fail.

1. We make money on it and buy/drs more GME in a fucking hurry, because SHFs can't control the price on blockchain like they can through PFOF. And that scares them. Keep in mind the stuff was $.40 a pop last week, which is a low barrier to entry.   
2. It's a pump and dump. And as retarded as we are, I don't think anyone in here is about YOLO onto LRC. We've all done this with GME, for the most part.

\- Consumable/transferable asset (can be used or transformed):  The token can also be used it to mint NFTS or pay for transactions/interactions on the network (whether it be in a marketplace or otherwise). It can also be converted it to another form e.g. BTC or ETH. This happens all on the same network/ecosystem and without the need for a middle man to move off ecosystem.

\- Store of value: Just holding the token itself is an alternative way of storing capital",1637144662,hkz0el4

You do know every NFT are under the hood blockchain right ? Using the existing infrastructure just make sense.
The way they release it is going to be different, the raw LRC token will be wrapped around by another resource. You won’t see it or use it as a LRC token but as a “GameStop dividend”.

You know how internet works? Under the hood every connection use the IP protocol, then some application use TCP or UDP which is wrapped around IP, some use TLS which is wrapped around TCP.

A crypto dividend will do nothing. 

GME issues, let’s say, an LRC dividend. Cool. They say here is enough LRC to give everyone one and only in per share. 

Brokers hand them out until they run out. Then they go to SHF and say “hey man, we still need LRC to give as a dividend”

So what happens? SHF go to the market and buy said asset. They give it to the broker and the broker gives it to the shareholder. If the dividend is not unique and truly limited to the number of actual shares, then they might as well be giving out a cash dividend because the SHF will have zero problem covering the dividends.

"So with the 61M added to LRC today, does this mean SHFs will need to buy up all of those tokens and distribute them to brokers as a digital dividend while also repurchasing shares from shareholders??? 

I mean, if this is true, then LRC will need to sell these tokens to hedgies driving up the LRC price while those hedgies also need to purchase shares back to close positions. Ho Lee Fuk.

Bro look up a DAO. Loopring is crypto so LRC token holders are going to vote on governance. Now GME could possibly be the whale that dropped for 63 mil Lrc so they have a large say in the protocol governance but they are not gonna buy them or merge with them. I know this isn’t debunking it but we have the opposite feeling. You could feel it as much as you want but that doesn’t make it true. In no world is GME going to merge with or buy Loopring… but would be dope to see a ton of LRC on their balance sheet in Q3. The doors are open for corporations holding BTC.

that is the rule though with options - it is always better to get out with some profit than try to time it perfectly

I think you all are being a bit unfair to the $100K in options guy

on a stock like GME where every week there is a new catalyst for MOASS it is almost impossible to exit options

Let's take today

1) LRC transfer of 61 million LRC tokens

2) Cycle Theory (Astro originally) has new variant saying Options Quarterly Cycle says Nov 23rd/24th

if you have options - will you sell

next week could be next leg up

next month could be MOASS

Waaait wait wait a moment here…. So you need to lock up a certain amount of LRC to run an exchange right? And let’s say this 61 mil amount of LRC was to be locked up for the exchange… and then what if that 61 mil was divided up between all the share holders as a dividend. In turn everyone who was a share holder would really own part of the collateral for the new market that was created. No one would own this new exchange except the players.

Two questions: 1. Why 250k minimum tokens per exchange.. is that just something loopring decided? Is the exchange essentially purchasing 250k LRC tokens to utilize loopring protocol and if they don’t follow well they lose some tokens?? 2. People buy and sell LRC as cryptocurrency.. but it’s not a coin. Can tokens be listed on EX??",1637122563,hky571x

"Sorry if I make this clear but this post was not meant to provide any evidence as to how real the GME + Loopring partnership is. I was just trying to clear up what Loopring and their LRC tokens are - and thus allow people to speculate from there. 

Personally though, I just don’t think it would make sense for GME to create their own system, unless they plan for it to be centralised rather than decentralised. And that in itself I think would be questionable, since it goes against what NFTs and emerging technology strives for. 

Furthermore, Loopring is an open-source and extremely cost effective protocol. They wouldn’t be competing with Loopring, they would be greatly assisted by them. There aren’t any conflicts of interest as far as I can see, and it’s a win-win. At the end of the day, the only way the creators of Loopring make any money is if the value of the LRC token increases, and that means providing a very good and desired service to exchanges as a prerequisite. 

It would take a lot of money and man power for GME to develop a protocol such as Loopring for very little gain. That’s just my personal opinion anyway.",1637122300,hky4oc2

2. Figure is somewhat fungible with the 2021 estimate for loyalty &amp; adtech
3. Launch of marketplace with 6 weeks left in GameStop's Q4. With Opensea doing roughly $1-1.5B sales per month, it's possible that GameStop's new marketplace could do $100M in the first 6 weeks.

The number is more of a placeholder meant to provide a baseline for calculating off of. Opensea has done $1,509,764,009.21 in the last 30 days alone strictly from JPEG sales, so it isn't out of this world to think an actual marketplace that's properly built could do 1/12th of that amount.

"Look. Nothing is free. You have to pay for DRS, and you pay for orders in your broker. If you don't pay order fess, you are paying by data as you are the product.

I'm not sure if the counterfactual wallet will be able to receive tokens from CEXs like Binance. Since that would need direct support from Binance, and their support for L2s (and esp. Rollups) has been not optimal, I doubt it. Long Term, sure - but not in the foreseeable future, unless a big ruckus happens - and I don't what that ruckus while my funds are in custodial ownership.

A wallet is not expensive - gas fees are. You can, right now, go and create a wallet with Porter, Argent, TrustWallet, or Metamask\* - or a Ledger\*\*\*. You should get an Ethereum Mainnet adress of format ""0x1234567890abcdef"" and then you can send your LRC to this - Transaction Costs are paid in LRC (and depend on the gas fees of Ethereum\*\*).

After the transaction finished, you can then bridge the LRC from Mainnet to Loopring L2, if you want. Regardless, as soon as it is on your own eth address and your own wallet, it is in your name.

\*Metamask is the easiest and the bare minimum for a software wallet/hot wallet - just make sure to never share your private key, seed phrase, recovery phrase, or any QR Code from Metamask unless you know what you doing (dont screenshare your Metamask). Don't go to weird links, take up on offers and wins that sound too god to be true, or fake websites that are ""simulating"" metamask. Noone will ever ask you for the private key or seed, and no one needs it, except for your eyes only.

The other Wallets are a little bit more complex, but offer additional benefits like social recovery, safety measures, a own L2 for transfers, and stuff.

\*\*Gas Fees right now are the lowest in 2/3 months I think? Pretty ok, honestly.

\*\*\* Ledger is a hardware wallet (or cold wallet/cold storage) - you have to buy it first. Your private keys and seed is stored on the physical device, which is virtually unhackable/stealable.

**In short: Not your keys, not your wallet. Not your wallet, not your tokens/coins/shares. You don't own anything - you are a record in a database on Binance, until you transfer your LRC out.**

**As you don't know the private key to Binance wallets, since they keep your LRC in a custodial/beneficiary ownership in their wallet, you don't own LRC.**

Do you plan holding? Then transfer out.

Obviously, not financial advice, do your own research - starting by reading Docs on Binance and Metamask. If you have more questions, just post 'em :)

And, last one: Just like DRS, make sure that you know what you are transferring to where and how - double check address, location, and stuff. Ownership in your name is awesome, with huge benefits and rights - but also, if you fuck up, in 99.99% of cases, it is your own fault. This is not meant to discourage you - but we all are a little pampered by ""call the bank to freeze the transfer"", ""I locked myself out of my account and lost my password"", ""customer support helped me with creating the wire transfer"", ""everything is seamless with no fees"" - which also opens the gates to ""everything you do will be monetized"", ""well, we are holding it for you, but in our terms"", ""trust me bro"", and other shenanigans.",1639317078,ho8usyv

I believe that the token is deflationary because it has a fixed supply, despite the fact that LRC gets burned - but if this is true I would expect the amount of tokens required to be staked to participate within the network as an EX would decrease as the price of LRC potentially rises. So, it would still cost the same amount to stake the necessary tokens to participate, but it would just mean that you would require less tokens. Those are just my thoughts.",1637118661,hkxx2kn
Sorry what the fuck is an LRC and where/why are they deposited,1637118540,hkxwtbj
"&gt;In no way does this imply that the LRC token has no value, or that it’s current value does not have a fundamental reason to increase - but it doesn’t grant any benefits to the end-user of the protocol itself. Only for those who wish to participate in the functionality of the Loopring ecosystem.

Deep Hamster Thoughts: So, there are 1.3B LRCs in circulation. If each exchange stakes only 250k, they can theoretically support a maximum of 5,200 exchanges. As each exchange makes their stake, 250k LRC are effectively taken out of circulation. Since the remainder can be traded, and have a monetary value, wouldn't it become progressively more expensive for subsequent exchanges to ""purchase"" their stake and join? Not only that, those that have staked will see their ""investment"" appreciate over time, should they decide later to exit (assuming their stake is returned to them when they do).",1637118238,hkxw5nq
"1. First of all let me clarify. Loopring’s layer 2 solution, and their unidirectional order model are seperate things that perform similar tasks, but with key differences. The Layer 2 scaling solution is to increase the scale of Ethereum transactions using zkRollups and is based on maintaining security whilst reducing the gas fees associated with transactions within the network. The bundling of transactions is an order model for the exchange protocol that expresses orders as token-exchange requests, instead of buys(bids) and sells(asks). This enables the best rates of exchange between tokens rather than traditional price discovery. As to L2 competitors - There are plenty. Although I **personally** think Loopring has the best technology for the short, medium, and foreseeable long-term. 

2. The protocol is beneficial for anyone that wishes to use financial services (such as those offered by B1nance and CB) within a non-custodial and decentralised network. Which can hopefully pave the way for access to a wider range of non-custodial and decentralised financial services rather than just exchanging tokens. 

3. I will have a look at this, but from my current understanding it makes no sense. Staking LRC tokens does not provide liquidity for GME.

"I don't think that LRC is going to be the dividend, to be honest. I've got no proof to back that up, just my gut and a speculative, largely smoothbrained ""what if"".

That ""what if"": The possible GME/LR partnership is looking increasingly likely to be fact rather than rumour. Is it possible that Gamestop could mint a float's worth of their own token *using* LRC to distribute as a dividend? LRC is deflationary, and 97% of it's already in circulation. Between an imminent supply shock, decreasing supply (with increasingly disproportionate demand as Gamestop moons following the dividend if this is true) and a marketplace that exclusively uses either LRC or GME's new token... what if one of the goals of the partnership is to secure LRC's place as a critical currency for the creation and distribution of GME's dividends? Not only securing the conditions for Gamestop to moon effectively indefinitely, but also giving LRC another dimension of tangible value that will see Loopring moon as well?

This is of course my speculative opinion, and not financial advice. If I'm flat out wrong/being dumb with any of this, feel free to correct me. I still don't know a whole lot about the ins and outs of crypto, so I don't know how possible (or not) this actually is.",1637117986,hkxvl72

"I have a tfsa, ws, and cs account lmao.

And ever since your guys sentiment changed, I've been buying lrc 4x a day. :).

Still holding gme, but just to keep the float locked.

Glad I swapped all my 3TH and @D@ for some sweet LRC today 👍,1637114281,hkxn6h1

"Yep you're right - corrected where I called it a coin in the middle paragraph.  I will say it was interesting having an ""ICO - initial coin offering"" for LRC in 2017.  Gotta have that parallel to IPO I guess? Although they could just make the C stand for crypto",1637113441,hkxl8vn
"Quick question, if there only 60 mil then how would we all get one per share?

Am I understanding this thought process- they assign a LRC to each share, that process goes off without a hitch and all appropriate parties are involved. The. They assign a set specific amount of nfts to each share, something that MMS can’t buy, and then obviously there won’t be enough so then it’s proved to be naked shorted and at the same time proving that all parties involved are complicit in illegal activity or at the very least proven to be piss poor at their jobs. Is that what I’m reading in this post?",1637113418,hkxl6yp

"Don't forget that the 60mln LRC can be used as liquidity to offer the GME token. They could potentially offer 7 GME tokens for every share you hold and the only way to get the GME coin initially is to be a shareholder, like a pre-launch",1637113152,hkxkku3
"Ty for the info. The thing with Loopring is that they are of Chinese origins. And so far, all the Chinese cryptos have been pretty scammy. So I think it's strange everyone is jumping on the LRC train so easily.",1637113141,hkxkjzs
"Also, if there's 2 billion synthetic shares out there, GME pays for 63 million LRC tokens, and shorts/market makers/brokers have to buy an LRC for every other share, or close the short position.

Buy GME to close, share price squeezes.
Buy LRC in lieu, token price squeezes.

If GME had previously bought up a bunch of tokens for pennies each, the dividend would be very inexpensive to GME, and VERY expensive for shorts to provide in lieu, since the price has gone up like 4000%.",1637113112,hkxkhij
wat doing lrc,1637112962,hkxk4yj
Coinbase is showing 1.4 billion LRC in circulation.,1637112933,hkxk2iw
"But they are still fungible right? I mean, if they were to give LRC as dividends, shf could pay up the money equivalent, which is a couple dollars rn, to eah share short, as they did for overstock, and be done with it.

I cheer for pokemon based gme exclusive nft as dividend, that shit would really be priceless. With some being more scarce than others, eg Charizard being more valuable than caterpie, there would truly be no cash equivalent for such a dividend",1637112915,hkxk110
"if each share of the float is represented by 1 lrc and thus 1 nft I'm gonna be a rich.

the ratio of 1 to 1 is significant and let's us know about our multipliers

you should buy more gme and buy more LRC NFA just what I'm doing",1637112895,hkxjzbl

"You might be missing something on the math here.  60 million LRC tokens doesn't equal the 76.49 million outstanding shares.  

Are you saying that insiders/select institutional shareholders are okay with waiving their right to a dividend?  The difference could potentially be the number of registered shares held by retail, so you could also be suggesting that only street name shares/institutions/insiders get the dividend??

The other more potential options here are a) this represents compensation paid by GME for the NFT marketplace which loopring is flaunting as a breadcrumb (aka work complete with all bills paid) or b) this has nothing to do with GME at all.",1637112498,hkxj35q

I ain't saying they in or out this madness, but ffs, it's all conjecture.",1637112230,hkxihiw
"LRC will not be used as a currency of any sort. LRC is a utility token. It is something that exchanges must stake in order to participate in the Loopring protocol, to incentivise positive behaviour in the network and to provide security and reputation. LRC tokens are the ‘bond’ that participating exchanges must purchase from the Loopring platform to stake. There is utility outside of this purpose, but this is a huge part of it. It’s not trying to be the next B1tcoin.",1637112187,hkxie2u
"I like that someone finally said LRC has a cash value mooting the situation.  Dumb question could someone mint or NFT an LRC Token?  Don’t understand crytpo nor Loopring but seems like I’ve read people will run their own market places.  So these 60M could be unique in that market place?   Probably not, dunno, hence the question. 

If so then there would not be a cash equivalent and the theories of the day that this purchase is somehow related to GameStop float.",1637111661,hkxh77y
If GameStop purchased LRC to distribute a future dividend they did so months ago at around 40 cents per LRC. If hedgies are forced to pay cash equivalent it will cost them around 5-6x per share more than GameStop paid.,1637111428,hkxgo63
1. sumthing billion lrc in circulation... shf would have to buy entire equal to amount of rehypothecated shares.. probably shorted hundreds of millions of shares. they are already hurting liquidity wise this would be almost impossible to pull off. this plus world financial bubble id assume everything is gonna be cascading down soon.,1637111210,hkxg6fc
"In the most basic form they would give you instructions on how to set up a wallet (most likely Loopring's new wallet), and your brokerage or ComputerShare would send the tokens there.  And then you can stake them or not, do whatever you want with them.  Sell them immediately if you wanted.

I have \*no idea\* what this project looks like.  There could be a more complex way to actually tie the shares to LRC if they pulled the shares from the DTCC, but I doubt that's what they're doing at launch.",1637111081,hkxfvxt
"This is complete nonsense.  LRC is a cryptocurrency coin like any other.  It just so happens that, when you pay fees with LRC to transact on the Loopring L2 for NFTs or on their DEX, you'll get a better deal than if you pay those fees with ETH.

The most likely purpose of this LRC is to seed the liquidity pool.  When loopring pumps like crazy, portions of this will be converted to other currencies and kept in the liquidity pool to support the Loopring DEX (decentralized exchange).

"Well this is basically just highlighting the ""no cash equivalent"" aspect of NFT's. 
There is no reason to do the LRC dividend, other than to get shareholders using the LRC platform/wallet whatever.

"It preemptively torpedoes the hand-wavy argument of ""it's blockchain stuff which is why we can't do it"" from the DTCC.  Show their record keeping has introduced prejudice to giving out dividends, potential share recall grounds.

You're right though, they could just do the NFT dividend first and fight that legal battle.  I'm just trying to see what sort of strategy could be behind using 60M LRC tokens",1637110555,hkxepkk

"I dont know exactly how loopring's marketplace will work but generally you have to pay the fee to mint or claim an NFT from a layer 2. So the 1 lrc would pay for that claiming for free, so that jo one would feel like they're being forced to on ramp to ethereum, then to loopring, then swap eth to lrc, just to claim their nft.

"You’re right to advise people not to get rattled by SHF tactics and dips, but I do believe the LRC announcement could kick off MOASS. Here’s why:

If the announcement hype pushes the price up at a time when the SHFs are in a collateral squeeze (as they could be this week when Evergrande finally finally finally goes pop on paper), it could trigger a margin call and off we go.

No guarantees, we can’t be sure how deep in Evergrande they are or where the tipping point to trigger Marge would be. But I think that’s why they are hammering us this last few days: to get the price down before announcement, so a 20% bump in price goes from maybe 100 to 120, instead of 160 to 192. It’ll give them breathing room to find stuff to offset their now worthless Evergrande collateral.

* Matt Finestone helped create LRC in 2018
* Matt Finestone is now at block chain with Jake Chervinsky
* There is a strong connection between LRC and GME
* Put those facts together, and you will come to the conclusion that this 4D Chess Move has been in play way before DFV, while DFV was closely watching RC prior to DFV initial buy in....his own research was being conducted at minimum 1 year before posting his position in Double You Ess Bee

If you can get you come LRC loopring on Coin Base Pro I'd look into it.",1639450187,hognyx0
This is the only thing that makes sense to me really. An LRC based market where companies can issue any new securities or dividends. I really don’t know how all this stuff works but I imagine GME will be the first member on the new market and will issue a new shares there as a dividend. New companies can have IPO’s through the new market that are all blockchain based so nobody fucks with them.,1639449147,hoglmy6
This is my problem too.  No more money except what's in LRC,1639448832,hogkxja

"I can’t say I’m positive on GME today.   I kept buying past 140 for months, but I’m not selling because this company is going places.   Eventually the short sellers will close and the stock will normalize at their fair market value, which is much higher than it is now.   At least I bought in to LRC at $0.60 though.   And in a big way.",1639448020,hogj3rv
"Purely anecdotal, but I just set up my Loopring wallet and did not find it easy. Objectively, when I go back over the steps, it IS easy. But... it's a foreign process with foreign terms. And even though Loopring's wallet is nice and user friendly, I wouldn't say it's intuitive; it's all geared towards concepts/transactions few people understand. And certain things are missing that we're used to. No name, address, social security, etc. You set up a wallet, use QR code/address to deposit enough ""whatever crypto"" for gas (converted to ETH), and I was sending over a not insignificant amount of money/resource that could totally be lost if I made a mistake. So it's for those reasons customer support will be important. (Yes, there will be a free wallet, but I already had the LRC and transferring from Coinbase would not work with the free wallet. It will be useful to buy directly from the free L2 wallet and trade exclusively on L2, but it's meant as a ""try before you buy"" experience. Just an FYI if it didn't make sense why I'd buy now.)",1639446431,hogflbj
Loopring has a trading contest that runs Dec23 to Dec 30 with $600K in prizes. They are also updating the service to support higher number of users on Dec 20. I suspect it’s all related to the contest. Last year LRC price pumped during this time too.,1639763652,hoy1oo6

No conspiracy theories?  Here's a few from Top (Day) 

https://redd.it/rhjnsu 

Reminds me a lot of what happened with other 'political' subreddits. Obviously Stonk is going to be censored, obviously. 

https://redd.it/rhytyy 

If you can't see why Fidelity - or anyone else - would invest in Reddit I don't know what to say. Clearly Fidelity are plotting on shutting down the Stonk, obviously. 

https://redd.it/rhedx0 

People literally giving baseless shitty advice, about something they clearly have no idea of. No, obviously the anonymous broker in question - which is obviously Fidelity, amiright? - has no legal right to prevent insider trading. Clearly they want to make sure they have all of the control.


I didn't say this sub is explicitly spouting 'Deep State' rhetoric. But the sheer depth that people seem to think this thing runs, and how everything is explicitly connected to GME and everyone is out to get them really makes it seem to imply a level of paranoia one would associate with any 'Deep State'  conspiracy. 

Also, really? You think Superstonk stays on topic? Buddy, there's a million different posts about Loopring, PleasrDAO, Evergrande, the Treasury Balance, RRP, etc etc etc. Hell, there are people pumping LRC in Superstonk, like, what? 

Not radicalized? People are hoping for the complete and utter collapse of the US - and by extension, the world - economy. And yeah, cool, we hold GME so we're safe. But then when you try to tell people how they can save themselves and you point them here, do you really think they'd jump in? Honestly? When people get so upset over such petty things? And people are called shills or FUDsters for having a different opinion?  My guy, if jumping to conclusions were an Olympic Sport this sub would have the platinum. 

I can't possibly be trying to scare off new users because they don't sort by New, they see what's in Hot. And if you really believe that MY post is the thing that breeds the paranoia then I have to ask you what flavor of Kool-aid is your favorite. 

I agree - and I'm not an FA - Buy, hold, and DRS what you're comfortable with.

"i have no fear. uncertainty and doubt are a logical response to all that GME shareholders have been through. i have 101 shares and 100 of them are DRS’d. i have LRC as well. i have almost a year of being a part of everything we’ve all gone through.

it’s also been a year of keeping shareholders in the dark. of breadcrumb shitpost tweets from RC made to keep us all hyped and guessing their supposed hidden meaning. of multiple quarterly meetings and voting and DRS’ing and everything else that LITERALLY HAS AMOUNTED TO NOTHING AS OF TODAY. 

nothing but people in here saying ‘trust me bro’ and proselytizing and creating the biggest echo chamber EVAR.

I know that sounds counterintuitive, but you can see why by examining these two possible scenarios:

A: Loopring is working with Gamestop

Finestone is likely under NDA and doesn't want to break the contract and get sued. He also shares business interest with GME as a whole and wouldn't want to leak that information for the same reason they would have NDA's to cover it.

B: Loopring isn't working with Gamestop.

Finestone is likely not under NDA. He might or might not talk about Loopring, since it is a company he once worked for and might still be interested in what they are doing enough to comment on it publicly.",1639694718,houas7j

"Is there anything you could do if MOASS hits and you don't have financial constraints?

I think that's what they mean.  But I think that you and I (and most) also fight internally a war you're personally focused on in this thread and we can relate.  It's all about balance, if we yolo all our time and money and energy into this stock (and I kind of have in phases), it was a long year and can feel unproductive or 'waiting' for something to happen before 'we do' things that from the third person are disconnected.  

Taken to an extreme even beyond how we spend our time, money, and view work or value family--beyond all the roles and changes we daydream-- we all have our version of stupid unrelated shit like drinking less (for me, but I do my best to disconnect it, just have a list of new priorities post MOASS).  For some it's losing weight, or related to stability and security, or fixing their body or mental health or all they can with their family or people they've hurt...etc..  

And balancing that we 'do it' now, we yolo what we CAN yolo while living now, starting businesses etc..  I got married on the 11th and we're buying a house next 17th, selling one I've owned a decade later, idk but life is constant change and flux and I think the point is to live it.  The best we can hope is that every birthday finds us as a better man, I never had any exit strategy but up even though the price valuation in a snapshot isn't always accurate.  

This year I've only gotten infinitely better at that and ironically it's almost the first year self improvement wasn't my focus in a weird tangential way--it's the year I started believing in myself, making moves I follow my intuition about, willingness to take bigger risks I understand better my own DD and for once not metaphorically trade sideways my whole life.  I yolo'd multiple times into GME and once into LRC--I've never sold.  We keep learning more about the world around us, learning to use simple then more complicated tools, and we've accidentally learned more about ourselves (and I've found greater financial stability even while finding greater war chests to start to stake claim over the world- starting with and ending with MY company).  

I don't think you're trying to argue with others here at all, I think you're having the same arguments you're speaking out inside yourself--but so do we all.  And we do our best.",1638221243,hmkxa2i

&gt;1. Is it possible to send funds to CS from bankaccount? 

You need to send USD. Some people have used a wise account which they top up with their local currency then convert to USD to be taken when buying directly from CS

You can also do this, route thru IEX if you're buying from IBKR then DRS'ing to CS

No one knows how this will be distributed etc we don't know it'll be on the LRC network...

Yes but the gas fees are high, wait for their counterfactual wallet release which will make this considerably cheaper to setup

"🛑&amp; Listen &amp; think, Do we really think its in our best interest to expose GameStop and reason as who why they have kept this vote information in under a tight lid.

I'll take all the downvotes, shill accusations /  I care about the GameStop chess play

**So lets get real for a moment** 

&amp;#x200B;

Ryan Cohen , RC Ventures, and GameStop have been  developing, building, branding, hiring, the best of the best teams to make a new fully functioning De-Fi exchange, yet apes are furious. What's going to change if the vote count is more or less?  In all honestly this jsaonwaterfall has opened up a huge portal for shills to possibly distract the real apes from determining weather this can hurt the company and their element of surprise !

&amp;#x200B;

Ryan Cohen has known Matt Finestone the guy who wrote the book on Loopring some time ago, its my conclusion that RC and Matt Finestone knew the gaming industry is a multi billion industry and new technology will get it there, Ryan Cohen also wants to create market fairness on a global scale.. **why  in the world are we intentionally trying to get in their way ???   Why.....** Again in doing this it will only create problems. As I look at it, Jasonwaterfalls does not trust GameStop he has it out for them and could possibly force them to telegraph information that can hurt Gamestop and help the competition.

&amp;#x200B;

Ryan Cohen stated "" we will not telegraph our next move to the competition "" yet here we are forcing their hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, I highly doubt GameStop executives are worried about  the vote count, could it be that the DTCC will not allow them to disclose this information to us....Then why not issue a summons  / court appearance to the  **DTCC who sits at the head of Table Of Fuckery.** GameStop issued a vote count to get a new chairman and changes on the company, possibly already knowing there are more voters than shares issued no fucking brainer.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I read the jasonwaterfalls posts there is a resounding message in the comments yea do it,  fuck them its my right, who fucking cares, I want to know, gamestop is not being honest, blah blah I feel most of the comments with no actual information are pushing the wrong narrative.

&amp;#x200B;

Who  is Jasonwaterfalls,  has anyone done  DD on him, is he the right man for the job? not bashing the guy but from the looks of his past posts we only  know as much as he has shared with us..... 

&amp;#x200B;

Once it goes through and I settle in, I may send more over soon. I don’t trust any broker or anything off of blockchain in terms of impartiality and validity. Who’s to say ComputerShare can’t be bought out from under us for the price of, idk, the US Constitution?

Ken shorting LRC now? Suck my loopRING kenny 🖕🏻,1638830085,hnintvc
"Hahah so true! Man they really are 5 steps ahead. 
Kenny trying to FUD saying games are downloadable, meanwhile RC is already in in Web 3.0, defi 3.0 and GameFi with his LRC partnership and NFT marketplace. 
Bruh if you aren’t milking by the tits you’re just not informed enough",1638828655,hnikb2q
"Yes, i hold a good chunk or LRC myself and I do expect it to see.go up significantly both in the near and long term",1638828598,hnik5ry
what are the odds they announce nft stuff using LRC and then it turns put to be sell the news event,1638828568,hnik35l
LRC team swinging their tits heavily today,1638828493,hnijwho
"Please go to the loopring sub before you do any of that, and make sure you're aware of what your doing, whether you should wait for the counterfactual wallet (release soon). The cash to open the L1 wallet is due to gas fees.

If all you're looking to do is to buy LRC, you can do so on Coinbase.",1638828246,hnija4v
I started with 920 LRC in crypto dot com and finished with 880 LRC in L2 wallet. Most of my losses occured on crypto dot com by going LRC-&gt;BTC-&gt;ETH. I don't know the exact cost to open the wallet but I'm pretty sure it was under $40,1638828234,hnij91h
"So I just tried to download the lrc wallet app, and it asked for a stupidly high amount of cash to open an account, am I doing something wrong or is there some kind of process I need to do, in order to buy LRC?",1638828032,hniir05
What I did is bought lrc on coin base then transfered to my lrc L1 wallet I have in the app. What that does is force coin base go buy actual lrc and transfer it... Hint hint it took them 12 hours to send my lrc to my wallet cause they had none 😂 fucking coin base just like I did to the brokers by drsing my shares.,1638827575,hnihl15
And... who's divesting from GME to buy LRC? Apes don't sell.,1638827279,hnigt6w
"Most people who are excited about LRC already held LRC, I've not seen a single person saying you should buy LRC coin because it doesn't matter if you do or don't (For GME) the technology is all we are drooling over and you don't need LRC to use the tech.",1638826311,hnieb1k
"Im in LRC for the same reason I'm in GME. I believe in the company.  Without GME, LRC will still do really well. I doubt there are many apes even in LRC. Not enough for it to matter if they sold.

The crypto veterans knew how to buy and hodl well before apes and GME came along.",1638825775,hnicxgv
"I read the paper I see what you're referring too. True LRC wasn't mentioned by name, however I see the endgame comment as this tech moving in the right direction in his eye. LRC included",1638825090,hnib5k6
I bet this whole campaign of getting GME investors to divest from GME and go into LRC is a trick! Lmao,1638824871,hniallk
"Depends on the platform, coinbase lets you buy LRC directly. You can also convert ETH to LRC. 

I am waiting for the release of their counter factual wallet so I can move my coin to a wallet and actually own it instead of having ""bought in my name""..... basically like DRS for crypto.",1638824658,hnia20a

Eh kinda. He talks of the value of zkrollups (which lrc is) and mentioned looprings competitors names but not loopring. Kind of a bummer.,1638824537,hni9qpl
"PAPA COHEN MAKE ME A RICH MAN! 

LRC 🚀 🚀 

WILL USE MY LRC GAINS in the future to buy MORE GME!! 

VICE VERSA!",1638824308,hni95ac
Need a third button for lrc.,1638822476,hni4cgc
I own some lrc that I bought a few months ago as I am personally into crypto. But 1000 isnt going to happen. Maybe 20 or 30,1638822154,hni3ibd
There are many ways to do it easiest would be buying LRC directly with fiat but you can also swap directly with any crypto you have.,1638821984,hni32i1
"Layer 2 blockchain. zk-rollups allow for combing a large number of transactions, usually thousands at once, and then writing them all at once to a layer 1 chain (mainly Ethereum in the case of LRC).  The benefit of this is that the cost of writing a transaction to an L1 chain (gas fee), then becomes shared among all of the transactions in the zk-rollup. 

This is probably somewhat mechanically innacurate, but thats the jist as this smoothbrain understands it.",1638821525,hni1w0t
I have their wallet as an app but don't know how to transfer my LRC from Coinbase to the wallet. Sorry I'm a noob too in regards to crypto.,1638821419,hni1maa
I think a more realistic announcement is the acquisition of 250k-1milly LRC to secure the marketplace. I believe that alone is all the confirmation we need to shoot the stock up. It’s irrefutable proof that the two are tied to each other for future endeavors. It would show the rest of the market the conviction GameStop has in loopring to execute with scale. Something as subtle as that nominal disclosure of how many loops our company has acquired since last earnings call.,1638821269,hni18q1
"So is this some kind of of quasi LRC staking? (Wish they had integration with CB wallet, guess I gotta get a metamask)",1638820251,hnhyn0t
"Totally agree, but aside from earnings the pleasrDAO guy retweeting his gme + lrc tweet saying this is going to be a big week, and remote  engineers traveling to Florida this week. expecting nothing, but my tits can’t help but be slightly jacked",1638819680,hnhx6nx
"Yup, I’m in LRC good and this just made me spill. I need a couple sets of pants this year for Christmas if someone can do me a solid cuz my fiat is in LRC right now.",1638819544,hnhwu8v
Oh boi I already see myself ordering my gamestop shares routed through LRC,1638819441,hnhwkqc
"I'm really having a hard time understanding all of this - where to buy cc's, connecting accounts/credit cards seems to never work properly.. then you buy it somewhere but then transfer it to a wallet to actually own it? I can't get retardedly clear enough answers anywhere to understand.. perhaps I am overthinking.. been trying to buy LRC and like, store it somewhere (?) for a couple months now and I just dont fucking get it.

Like what is Etherium? Is it a currency? What is LRC? Is it a currency that runs on a currency? Fuck me.",1638817639,hnhs08a
is LRC the only token on Layer 2?,1638817491,hnhrmju
"Buy LRC for short term stonks before moass, it's like $2 per lrc get it for real it's gonna be $1000 by feb save this comment",1638817375,hnhrc1w

Meanwhile lrc is up 20% since that tweet and gme is down 2%,1638817260,hnhr1k1
"I don't know who he is or what any of it means, but I'm holding LRC and Wu Tang Clan ain't nothin to fuck wit",1638817252,hnhr0t6
"LRC moving up quickly, GME weird today…I hope sth is cooking :)

And if not - then somewhen else 🙌🥳🎊🎉🚀

I am jacked to the tits!!!",1638817011,hnhqema
"What if the dividend is just 1 LRC per share. If GameStop bought them when it was $0.5, it's just $35m. But with LRC currently sitting at $2 and could rose to $10 after the announcement, that's a lot for hedgies.",1638816843,hnhpz6y
"uhhh, is buying some LRC technically supporting GME at this point as well?  (friend wants to know...)...",1638815489,hnhmick
GME and LRC simultaneously popping with a similar chart.  Totally normal right?,1638815298,hnhm0mn
"In general - the interest in this space. It's something that *everyone* is trying to plant their flag on. 

I'm personally still a bit skeptical, but that's my nature. But I do think a company is going to figure this out and revolutionize how we think about the industry. If I were smart enough to know what that looked like, I wouldn't be on this chat right now - lol.

Honestly, I have no idea what GME has in store. I personally have had no contact with anyone from the company. And I don't know if loop is going to be legit or not, but I've loaded up thousands of lrc just in case.",1638814735,hnhkkia
LRC?,1638814653,hnhkcyb
"I'm not a crypto expert, so how does it work?  Do you buy ETH, then connect your wallet to Loopring and swap it for LRC?  Or can you directly buy LRC?",1638814252,hnhjcdy
"Sooo the PleasrDAO member literally just tweeted $gme and $lrc #layer2 lol

Do with that what you will",1638813666,hnhhuk5
"Follow MSM? No, thanks I got RC, GME &amp; LRC that’s all the info I need fuck the rest.",1638813525,hnhhhjs
Dropped in some more LRC today cuz I had a feeling in my plums.  Hold and keep it going!  I ain’t selling!!!!!,1638813383,hnhh4dq
This man has Zero involvement with a GME or LRC. His tweet means nothing,1638813308,hnhgxfk
"I’ve linked to today’s tweet and the 11/23 tweet that it was quoting. Specifically, LRC was cut off from the quoted tweet in the OP.",1638812700,hnhfcyi
He might also just be invested in LRC and posting his opinion that isn't actually backed by anything more than anyone's opinion here though.,1638812552,hnhezhb
lrc,1638812443,hnhepc3
I own both GME and LRC. Will I be rich?,1638812259,hnhe8cu
He’s right but shilling a shitcoin. Funnily enough we already have a stock. We don’t need a coin. LRC is our cousin coin,1638812120,hnhdvhq
Right.. because that’s big news on LRC and GME and he isn’t quite the person to be in charge of those things,1638811612,hnhckiw
👆💯🎯🎯☑️☑️the basics...forgot your LRC,1638811590,hnhcigy
Good news but I need to hear something from GME or LRC 🤞🏼,1638811471,hnhc7gb
"Had to actually look up 'GameFi'. [Holy Shit](https://tradesanta.com/blog/play-to-earn-gamefi-nft)   

Anyone who can put 2 and 2 together can see the potential. And GME and LRC would most certainly be in the forefront of this.",1638811334,hnhbuxl
"Not really sure about his actual plan, but maybe I could theorize in general for you.

If I was to do such a thing, I'd setup a DAO to manage this stable coin. The DAO is what is tokenizing the gold into a coin and managing that. The tokenomics could look like this: when someone buys a coin, 80% goes to buying more gold, 10% goes to overhead expenses (like the vault the gold is stored in, salary for people managing this, etc) and 10% burn rate.

I'm not really sure how burn rates work with stablecoins but I guess it'd increase the value of the coins which would then increase the value of the gold? It'd help keep that 1 coin : 1 unit of gold ratio intact since you have 10% overhead expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I'm not putting much value in metals or gems post MOASS. I see it as a legacy source of value and Bitcoin/Etherium being the new source of value (with coins like LRC being the new source of stocks).",1638810977,hnhaxsb
This will go unnoticed but… does anyone else think LRC is reverse mirroring GME?,1638993416,hnrbv1v
Question: Would GME have to disclose if they have purchased any LRC on the earnings call?,1638993278,hnrbi0y
it's because of LRC.,1638993211,hnrbbnj
Holy shit LRC,1638992992,hnrar7u
"hm maybe i do not understand that correctly. But the price expectation of LRC or GME is related to their prospective ? why are we waiting for a GME price higher than the current then? It is, in my opinion, an indicator at best. And i honor opinions based on valid assumptions. Let's just see how it goes :)

&amp;#x200B;

edit: by the way, i did not downvote you. i never downvote people for their opinion (unless it is harrassment). i prefer, to have every kind of opinion here to think about",1638992857,hnrae8a
"&gt;I’m willing to claim with certainty this partnership exists.

You are free to believe in unbacked things, such as vampires and ghosts if you want to.

&gt;If we don’t start talking about it before it happens, that’s a loss to this community of individual investors.

Because we could not be invested in both side of the equation?

This is all noise to ""please let me push LRC""",1638992777,hnra6nh

###### GME ~175.4638:🚀[MOAR DRSBOT:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qap4je/drsbot_4x_now_online/)🚀",1638991412,hnr6kei
Point something out in his tweet that is inaccurate or doesn’t relate to gme/LRC. I’ll wait.,1638990693,hnr4owy
I think you meant to say when they announce the LRC partnership because it's not an if at this point.,1638990543,hnr4avw
"He previously tweeted about GME and LRC, hard to say what he's tweeting about",1638990336,hnr3rbd
Absolutely nothing to do with GME or LRC.,1638989420,hnr1dbx
"I mostly agree. The Chewy playbook is not 100% applicable to GME because Chewy was privately held while he was making the majority of his moves.

With GME, there are certain requirements for a publicly traded company to provide information related to material events. So as long as they abide by that, I'm fine.

I don't need a roadmap, because I think it's pretty obvious.

I love that he hasn't said shit about their plan, yet. Why? Because those paying attention can easily see the new job openings and the developments happening on their marketing and e-commerce catalog, and hiring 300+ executives from top companies. Then the LRC connection is another monster in hiding.

So the changes have happened and are continuing to progress, even though he hasn't directly said anything.

What do people want him to do? Comfort us and tell them everything will be great? He has to execute and I want him balls deep into executing with actions rather than communicating a 10 year business plan to all our competitors.

I do understand both sides though. I have most of my $ with RC and it's easy to go into a dark place if the price tanks for days on end.

However, he already calmed any fears about what he's going to do with his shares. 

The market we are in is growing naturally, we have zero debt, growing sales, and a huge customer base to sell everything to. 

I sleep easy.",1638989190,hnr0r7t
"Hold = GME
Hodl = LRC",1638989115,hnr0k3o
"LRC is the biggest gainer over the last hour over all top 10 crypto 

Engines r starting",1638988701,hnqzgxf
That’s based off Tezos chain so wouldn’t interact with anything GS is building on LRC/ETH stack - this was probably released as an attempt to front run GS announcements,1638988559,hnqz3nv
loopring has finished fiat on ramping.  this was the final road block to an nft marketplace.  Now LRC only needs someone to open a DEX for nfts.,1638987814,hnqx5dx
"Loopring can be good at what it does, I don't really doubt that. I just don't think there is any association between LRC/Loopring and GameStop.

What are your arguments? Is it still the deafening sound of nothingness?",1638987456,hnqw7gi
and with that 50 more LRC purchased.,1638986049,hnqsijf
Do I just need to go ahead and buy LRC today?,1638985413,hnqqu1b
Yes there are two possibilities in this scenario that I am totally comfortable with. I believe in RC anyway. But the LRC/WuTang/BuckleUp Connection is really interesting imo.,1638984654,hnqoulf
"Yep, hence the hype around the projects.  Not only does LRC have the ability to make Ethereum far more accessible for everyone, but GME would be the “prototype” showcasing its application in a meaningful way.  People need to understand that this is capable of so much more than “silly NFT pictures” but the media is doing a bad job teaching the general public, or a good job if misinformation is their goal.",1638984221,hnqnq96
"I was thinking more in line of a crypto dividend after a partnership announcement. Maybe Q1.  Their last dividend was .38 cents in 2019, 1 LRC would of cost them around the same back in June. 

It’s worth plenty more now AND if there is an announcement it might pop off. 

It would be a nice wound if they put out a dividend worth 5-10 bucks. Especially if there are multiple floats worth of shares out there. 

Been thinking about this for a bit.",1638984098,hnqnes3
"A bit unrelated but I think worth mentioning in a 741 thread. 

I was unable to post due to karma requirements but a look at Matt Finestone’s last 3 Erc20 Token transactions are for values of 1,4, and 7. They are all in LRC and the most recent one was 22 hours ago.

Edit: They are from Matt Finestone to the GME wallet.",1638984030,hnqn8gc
"I’m in the loop. I just opened a loopring wallet and bought $3000 of LRC, so I hope I’m all set to buy stuff on any GameStop marketplace that could be announced.",1638983377,hnqljnc
so retards spend money buying lrc and not gme?,1638982617,hnqjk7z
"I’ve been thinking about a dividend the last few weeks. I’ve been wondering if maybe they’ll do a crypto dividend, LRC.  Hear me out, back in June when they made their 1B+ LRC was below .5 each.  Maybe they bought enough back then to cover the float.  They would be paying at 30 something mil for all of it.  

LRC has already made quite a jump. If they make an announcement I think it’d likely climb higher.  Maybe they are waiting for Q1 or sometime after a partnership announcement and LRC gets a boost and BAM they distribute a dividend worth maybe 5 bucks or more.   

This would may be a nice wound especially if there is way more than the float out there like we think. 

I dunno, just a thought.",1638982443,hnqj448

"Loopring, LRC, blockchain, NFT, pleasrDAO, Wu-Tang, counterfactual wallet, dividend. Just trying to see how many downvotes I can get from bots on one comment by including all the keywords it has been told to downvote. Did I miss any?",1638981895,hnqhny2
"Afraid....the party will stop ! Gotcha ❤️ 
I'm hyped as fuck 24/7. If the earnings today doesn't start MOASS, LRC will do something before end of q4 (Dec) and after that the one year anniversary, then next earnings etc etc 
11 months of this shit am I'm just getting warmed up. All these retarded chadtastical apes, like you, make this even more awesome !!",1638981894,hnqhnty
This is just untrue. Gas does not cost 100-200. So much fud. You can literally pay 10$ gas fee right now to trade eth. Although lrc will be virtually non existent gas like cents on the dollar. It's still a big improvement but this post is retarded.,1638981395,hnqgddm
"They aren’t selling anything. Also, if you see LRC  as a clout chaser from apes you are blind lmao. There is a clear connection. That tell’s me everything I need to know and that I am wasting my time with you. Good day.",1638980545,hnqe7xo
"&gt; possible press conference is irrelevant

NFT/LRC irrelevant?",1638979801,hnqccob
Took their bs classes and used the 20$ on Lrc 😂,1638979748,hnqc7x9
"I brilliantly decided one LATE night after drinking in October: to get into lrc, make the wallet, and put some on L2, AND get enough coin in 4 different currencies to coin a position on L2 as two Automatic Market Makers..

I mean that sounds ambitious starting out, but it was simple as fuck.  The problem is I was even more simple... I kept converting the damn coins on L1 before going to L2 THEN fucking for some reason I kept not only wasting so much extra gas, but accidentally not accounting for the gas loss and ended up having to make more numerous smaller transactions than I needed (plus I had my wallet and L2, should have done all LRC or whatever I had to L2 and then convert them to the other coins. 

If I'd have done it the more simple way that only makes sense now, I don't know how much I would have saved by today's values...  thousands.  And if I'd have just held it all in what it was originally (LRC) I would have made about $30,000 more by today's value.

I'm simple.",1638978427,hnq8xyy
"Congrats on your achievement dude! I’m not a member of this sub, just deviated here from the LRC sub briefly and now glad I did. I’m certain you’ve gained much clarity in these past six months, as I share a similar journey. May you have success in all you do and especially in sticking it to the institutional fuckers!",1638978417,hnq8x4w
Nothing to do with GME or LRC. Downvoted 👎,1638977910,hnq7of5
"I'm waiting for the counterfactual wallet, L2 wallet is just too expensive for me. So I have some LRC in Metamask and Binance.",1638977442,hnq6jeb
"Let’s clear something up - this really doesn’t have much to do with GameStop. In a way it does because Loopring has long said they hope to launch both the counterfactual wallet and the new marketplace around the same time. So if that single source piece of anecdotal info is right, the NFT Marketplace should be announced soon. 

But this post really is for anybody who holds LRC. Why it’s posted here and not the LRC sub? Not sure.",1638977441,hnq6jao
How are plsrdao and lrc connected?,1638977073,hnq5nti
"Yes it’s annoying, these guys are all about LRC and it’s quite obvious, why would they know anything that gme will do? It’s dumb! They pumping LRC as they know we love the hype but for them to know about what gme will do is hard to believe",1638976800,hnq50fw
"I'm super bullish on LRC but I also bet against my baby and have a position in MATIC as well (competitor.....unless they have a partnership to announce......)

I'm 80/20 in favour of LRC though.",1638976129,hnq3g1b
"But **could** have everything to do with LRC / Market place.

Either way, the price is going to dip.",1638976080,hnq3c0b
Yeah a lot of theories on here get a little too wild for my liking but there is a lot of good information that has come out of this place. Glad you changed your mind. I am really hopeful for this NFT marketplace and LRC becoming the potentially top tier DEX. I am so tired of CEX.,1638975843,hnq2s9x
"Why do people think a guy that purchased a Wu Tang NFT album somehow has information about GameStop and LRC and isn't just tweeting shit like ""buckle up"" for his own hype like NFTCon did?",1638975432,hnq1u5p
"LRC is going to moon on tech alone, the GME connection is just icing on the cake.",1638975379,hnq1pt0
"Which is also why I fucking hate using Eth. If you have ANY erc-20 coin you need eth in your wallet to do anything with it. You got LRC in your ethereum wallet? Wait? What? You dont have ANY eth in your wallet? Well that LRC is stuck. You will have to send Eth to that wallet (gas fees) to send LRC out (gas fees). WHOA WHOA WHOA. You thought that your 120 gwei in gas fees would be enough? Well the ethereum network just declined your transaction. The gas you spent is gone because you didn't pay enough. 

The whole gas situation was fine when that value of a transaction was fractions of a penny, but now it is just ridiculous. You could spend $20 to send something and it gets kicked back that the gas fee is too low. So you are stuck trying to figure out how much you need to spend to send something without overpaying in a timely manner (the more gas you spend the faster the transaction will be).  

&amp;#x200B;

 I have a eth accounts that have some value in each of them that are essentially stuck because the gas fees cost more than the underlying assets.",1638975340,hnq1mj6
No fomo. My brother is a gme ape and he I have a deal worked out where we both have tangentially related but separate investments (I'm deep into LRC for example) and will be sharing profits should they come.,1638975140,hnq166h
"Sign up on coinbase. Do the learn and earn and get some free crypto, trade free crypto for LRC with no fee. Hold LRC. Possibly financial advice.",1638973585,hnpxq5d
"If you can afford it, you should download the Loopring Wallet. That would allow you to move it all to L2 :) I’ve got about half of my LRC in metamask and the other half in the Loopring wallet for now. 

Or I guess you could just wait for the counterfactual wallet 😬",1638973529,hnpxlr4
Can confirm. Used the LRC dex. Swapping ETH for LRC with no fees was such a wonderful feeling.,1638973370,hnpx9ll
"If you’re not in the crypto space at all, but are curious, yet don’t wanna deviate from the play of plays… LRC is probably worth looking at.",1638973218,hnpwxxn
"Agreed. But Also, why are LRC and GameStop employees saying it’s going to be a big week? Why are employees traveling down to TX just earnings? Something seems fishy today. But I expect nothing as usual 😊",1638973027,hnpwjfd
"This has probably nothing to do with lrc or pleasrdao. They’re invested in A-V-A-X and that c r y p t o is currently undergoing a rough patch of red, so I would assume “buckle up” refers to that instead",1638972956,hnpwe2v
"That’s my point. Management runs the business. That’s Furlong. Directors worry about shareholder interests. That’s Cohen. He’s not chairman AND CEO as is the case with some companies. Business doing well is very important to shareholders obviously. And that looks bright. But MOASS has nothing to do with businesses future plans. However, the scale of the business everyone is contemplating can’t be done without huge amounts of capital. That requires MOASS for GameStop too. And when you talk about LRC and crypto, that needs to be backed by confidence to gain value and GME will be able to do that. “Your coins are good here; the new, better Amazon, where you buy everything with LRC or cash or other approved crypto.” None of this can scale up without MOASS.",1638972831,hnpw4qq
"Yep, that 115 would have been the gas fees. That’s what LRC is looking to eliminate with their upcoming update. It’s not GME making this better though, this is all on Looprings side. It’s just the GME is looking to use Looping for their own stuff.",1638972568,hnpvl7q
I'm chucking some tendies into LRC if this turns out to be true,1638972159,hnpurbw
"Honestly I reckon most people will be like "" the fuck is nft?"". I know I was confused. My smooth brain couldn't understand any of the jargon. I'm still smooth, but I'm smooth with some LRC tucked away.",1638972055,hnpuk07
"Agreed. There is no good way to permanently control access to an image on the internet. However digital games... Instead of a key code you use an NFT. Now all of a sudden that is a resellable asset because when you sell the NFT you lose access to your copy of the game. 

I really hope that is what the potential LRC/GME partnership is about. It'd literally be GameStop's core business model updated for the digital 21st century. 

IM JACKED.",1638971574,hnptlg2
LRC dividend would be cool.,1638971277,hnpszzs
Is AMP still in play for a LRC on ramp? Haven't heard anything about that potential lately.,1638971125,hnpsp84
"You do basically understand it.  ETH is like a network that is decentralized and secure, but costs “money” to use each time you interact with it.  The demand is high right now, and clogged up, which is also a good thing but it has driven the price up for interactions.  The creating of the wallet and it’s cost is an interaction on Layer1.

GameStop and LRC are attempting to get Layer2 started.  This is just an added layer on top of the network where transactions take place freely.  Then the “rollup” is kind of like a zip file.  It bundles up the interactions and sends them through Layer1 as one thing instead of 1000 things.  That fee you paid is then divided between everyone in the zip file so it’s almost not noticeable.",1638970901,hnps9gv
"Because lots of conversation here about LRC and NFTs.

Makes perfect sense.",1638970520,hnpritl
Yup because of LRC and the stupid pump n dump crowd.,1638970113,hnpqrds

"Also imagine dedicating so much time to hating and mocking us, like, I literally do not give a shit about them yet there they are trolling away in their echo chamber.

I used to imagine how good it would feel to win the lottery, the rush you know? Now with GME I sometimes think about how bad people like meltdowners will feel, they literally followed the saga yet pushed it aside instead of embracing the concept.

I have some crypto friends at work and they've heard about gme but not to the extent, I told them about LRC at £0.20 and they asked me why I was interested in it, mentioned GameStop and that basically led to asking me why I was bullish on that.. when LRC shot up recently they asked me more about GameStop, how to open a brokerage and where I heard about the partnership 🤣

Only thing though, they've still not bought in! One of them keeps saying he's gonna put 5k into GME and every time I bring it up (via crypto) he's talking about another shitcoin he's dumped 10k into. Told me he's trying to make 3mil so he can retire.. I'm like.. ""dude""!

"What more do you want to know? They are working with LRC. LRC is putting together a marketplace. LRC said it should be ready by the end of this month, and as of yet, they haven't announced any delays

GME paid off all their debt. The fulfillment centers and call center should be fully operational by now. 

It hasn't been a year and so much has changed in the company's favor.",1638924854,hnnuivk
Ok I can help with this.  You’re picking the one thing that you think would’ve turned out well. Keep in mind some of the other things let’s say you had used some leverage to buy LRC then this weekend when it dumped you would’ve been margin called and lost it all.  Or let’s say you had used cash to buy call options this last time when we all ‘knew’ it would run up.  Well more than likely you would have seen a gain and then gotten crushed on Tuesday when they crushed the price.  You would’ve lost all that.  Looking back you can pick anything as say oh if I had just done X I would’ve made so much money.  But you don’t see all the time you could’ve lost money.  What I do is I look back at all the times I could’ve paper handed my gme or maybe not bought in at all.  When you are feeling some fomo just realize you could be like so many that will miss out or worse yet lose money on gme coming up by misplaying this. It so easy to lose money in this space.  Don’t beat yourself up by looking back.  Hold or hodl,1638921242,hnnmywb

"I 100% support discussion on LRC, how it functions, speculation, education, etc.  There are many January apes who should relish on the opportunity to get in on something early.  Price action isn't as warranted for discussion but it still doesn't bother me much.

I think the *biggest* takeaway here is how long it has been since this sub had any discussions of substance.  It's been months.  LRC presents a perfect opportunity to actually talk about relevant things to the rebirth of GameStop.",1636642137,hk7hbuz
"Got banned from Jungle for it, amazingly. But the point is still spot on. I've talked with 2 family members, 1 work colleague, and a neighbor all about Loopring and where it was headed/why. They all got in within the past two weeks and are like wtf dude. How did you know? And now I'm slowing opening their eyes to Gamestop and NFTs, and the marketplace. Just wait, I say. 

But this wouldn't have been possible at all, without Loopring/LRC. It is a valid fucking gateway drug and much easier to explain than rehypothecation and naked shorting.",1636642061,hk7h5nr
He’s pumping LRC as a means to continue funding his scheme and knows the power of FOMO.,1636642035,hk7h3kx
"Those posts are not trying to get ppl in gme sub to buy something that isn’t gme.  Those posts speak to overall market movements that effect gme.  

You understand by promoting lrc, you are shilling lrc.  That is the definition of shilling.",1636641827,hk7gmxv
"&gt;Pumping lrc should be banned.


It's related to GME",1636641397,hk7fogz
Correct. Pumping lrc should be banned. Text DD about a partnership is different,1636641359,hk7flfw
"I think given the history of shilling that we’ve seen, it is understandable why the community has taken this stance.

Again, we’re not saying LRC isn’t the real deal, we’re just saying wait until GameStop officially says it, then there’s no concern.",1636641335,hk7fjj7
"LRC is already up 8 times since just 1,5 week ago lol",1636641332,hk7fjdi

What “DRS help” post??  Your post history only shows you pumping LRC…,1636640963,hk7eqp5

"All these LRC pump posts, mods: are you blind or bought?",1636640867,hk7ejb7
LRC posts need to be banned,1636640770,hk7ebut
I tried to comment in a thread about LRC and got a pop-up message that my comment wasn’t allowed. That is FUCKED up when LRC is such a great project and solves so many problems in the crypto world,1636640733,hk7e8yn
"GameStop might have ties to Loopring. GameStop doesn't seem to have ties to LRC. Feel free to talk about Loopring and GameStop, but leave LRC out of it.",1636640723,hk7e856

Should not be allowed",1636640721,hk7e80a
"Unpopular opinion but when RC said two options, HOLD or HODL, I thought he meant we can either HOLD GME or HODL LRC. Not financial advice in any way, but that's what I'm personally doing. Balls deep on both sides.",1636640710,hk7e76x
It requires a million LRC to build a DEX using their protocol. You don’t know what you’re talking about.,1636640630,hk7e0wh
Gj bro.  This is the way.  The lrc shills are strong here though,1636640589,hk7dxmt
I bought $50 of lrc about 2 weeks ago and sold $240 worth yesterday and bought another 1.2 shares of gme and still have another $50 in lrc. I wish I had put more than $50 on it originally,1636640568,hk7dw1l
If you want. Lrc posts are clearly being pumped here. I'm not born yesterday,1636640509,hk7drdu
Funny how LRC is banned In the main crypto sub... haha,1636640508,hk7drbt
"New to crypto. My understanding is that at present, you can transfer LRC from Coinbase to a Ledger Nano, for example, but the gas fees are prohibitive. There are two things pending that may change this: Etherium 2.0 rollout. Free smart wallet from LoopRing.",1636640487,hk7dpoa
i can make money off LRC *and* pump up gamestop’s assets???,1636640345,hk7dehm
"yeah that lrc ban that wasn't there yesterday when I was looking. sorry, says it was just posted 14 hrs ago. should have looked this morning.

ironic that an investement economy driven by memes and hype is banning something for too much hype??? lol",1636640128,hk7cy2i
thanks! fidelity was super easy/quick to set up. buying 3 shares at market open and pledging 1 more share for each $ LRC is worth up until Jan 1. i’ll figure out computershare this weekend. cheers!,1636640077,hk7cuby
"Full disclosure, I say all of this as a LRC holder. 

Superstonk has been infiltrated previously by those who would have us invest in things that are not the one true stock. Popcorn and GME together strong? Get out of here. ""FoRgEt GaMeStOp, BuY sILvEr"". No, I don't think I will.

Bring us fundamentals. Bring us additional links between the two. Bring us DD. Otherwise don't bring LRC, because it acts as a smokescreen for those just coming around trying to find an audience to hype a coin and pump their bags. We have room for the protocol, but not the coin and its price action. Leave that chat in the LRO sub.",1636640071,hk7ctxc
"I wouldn’t use etoro, but that’s just me. 

Go on Coinbase (an exchange), buy some (LRP/USD, assuming you are in US) using cards, then, learn to use Coinbase Pro (with cheaper fees), and learn to get a wallet. Ultimately, you need a hardware wallet to actually own the cryptos/token/LRC you buy off of an exchange. If it’s not in your wallet, it’s not yours.

Edit: LRC = LoopRing Coin. Sorry",1636640066,hk7ctj8
Best to store it in your Loopring wallet. Then you can buy other erc-20 tokens for very cheap using LRC compared to etherum gas fees,1636639883,hk7cg04
Doesn’t the fact that the media is posting lrc articles give you enough information that it’s being manipulated,1636639759,hk7c6qb
"Very sus; you should feel sus since it is against the rules to post something unrelated.  Lrc token is unrelated to gme + loopring tech nft.  Unless someone wants to show me some dd that connects theM.  Every lrc post is also filled with people spouting gain porn.  I’m glad for them, but this isn’t the place, there is a sub for that.

Do all the lrc you want, play it, this heavy lrc push into gme, though, is unacceptable.",1636639682,hk7c0yp
I don't know if I should keep my lrc or sell to buy gme...,1636639552,hk7br0s
So is buying LRC the same as investing in the LoopRing company? ie if I think the company is a good investment is that what I do?,1636639415,hk7bghg
GameStop the company must hold a certain amount of LRC tokens to operate an exchange on the Loopring protocol. While we are not sure what’s intended this is plausible and even likely.,1636639389,hk7beko
"Buy the rumor, sell the news is nothing else than a pump and dump. If you make $1 million with LRC others might lose if LRC goes back down. Net some apes win, some apes lose, overall it's money that could put extra buying pressure onto GME where during the MOASS all apes will win and SHF lose.",1636638848,hk7aanu
Make an lrc sub bro...call it gmelrc. This is gme sub tho,1636638793,hk7a6m2
Loopring != LRC,1636638706,hk7a07r
"That’s awesome, congrats!!!  LRC was my first Crypto play, initial buy in at .34 also because of GME rumors, I wish I had bought more.  Between the two of them, I’m looking to pay my house off.  Congrats again!",1636638686,hk79ynj
"The problem is that this post already exists, and undoubtedly in far more detail. We did this back in early October when LRC was $0.43

Until an announcement, leak, or interesting revelation happens Superstonk isn't the place to ""keep the hype train rolling"".",1636638547,hk79o8g
Have you heard the gospel of LRC?,1636638424,hk79f3s
LRC MOON,1636638420,hk79eu5
It’s silenced because the LRC guys flooded the sub with LRC to the moon showing gains and saying they were early. Not cause of GME,1636638333,hk798gq
"I sold my ADA and bought LRC around that price. At one point yesterday, had nearly tripled my initial investment. It's settling out now, but I still think they've got upside.",1636638289,hk795bk
"Hodling XXX GME &amp; XXXX LRC.

This is the new way.",1636638247,hk792dc
"""I view it as a once-in-a-lifetime, perfect-timing, far-reaching opportunity/challenge that I need to pursue for its own sake, and for my personal development. I cannot give more information at the moment, but I will be sure to do so when the time is right — I hope on the order of a few months. This opportunity will keep me firmly in the blockchain (Ethereum) space, so I hope to be seeing many of you around real soon :).

I will remain an advisor for Loopring. And not just the symbolic kind, but the real kind. I still hodl LRC, own equity in Loopring Technology Limited, and look forward to remaining part of Loopring’s bright future.""

This is the most breadcrumbly part I found. Nothing conclusive.",1636638064,hk78p6l
"Yup, the GME apes might just have done thr best strategic move by buying loopring. Its crazy but the crypto community seems to really enjoy buying lrc and buying gme, it blows my mind, this might be bugger than we al think🤯",1636638039,hk78nfw
"It’s part of the reason everybody needs to be more zen. Shitadel js not likely pumping LRC. It’s hype and FOMO for a cheap coin that has gone up 600%. Similar to any cypto. On the flip side GME is not buying LRC. If anything it’s simply a partnership like said before.

People just jumping to wild speculations because they’re bored and looking for confirmation bias. Long story short: but, hodl, and zen. DRS if you want to. NFA",1636637991,hk78jy9
"Buy the rumor, sell the news. Lrc is free and quick money.
I've been waiting for my gme millions for one year now and who knows how long we will have to wait.

If in the meantime I can make $1 million with LRC, it will be more easy to wait for the moass.",1636637949,hk78gwf
"Mentality of some on here isn't it.

I often take profit of investments and buy GME with it.Why should I see LRC different?",1636637749,hk782n4
"To create a DEX on loopring protocol, you must stake 250 000 lrc. 

It could be the same to create a Nft marketplace.

So yeah it is highly probable that GameStop bought some lrc",1636637697,hk77ysy
"THIS POST SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHAT LOOPRING DOES OR HOW IT CAN BENEFIT GAMESTOP. This post only says how pumping LRC is a vehicle to pumping GME by bringing on more investors.

You are more than welcome to enlighten us all on loopring, its technology, what it can do for markets. No users or mods are preventing that. If people read that and decide to place money in LRC, that's their decision. You are NOT welcome to discuss purchasing LRC for the sake of purchasing LRC.",1636637656,hk77vst
Been watching the LRC ticker saying I don’t do crypto since it was like 40 cents. It’s been very hard. The bitch is mooning,1636637565,hk77p94
"Fuck the doggy coin right in its stupid ass, lrc and gme LFG 🚀",1636637481,hk77j6i

It's going to be an important aspect of the NFT marketplace",1636637319,hk777sh
I don’t understand how folks leap to these conclusions but can’t imagine shitadel pump and dumping LRC.,1636637213,hk770b0
The mods must own LRC,1636637120,hk76tub
"as someone who has been in crypto for years, $50 is absolutely not insane. it will however likely take time and require a huge push (GME partnership could certainly be the catalyst). for some perspective, LRC at $50 still wouldn’t put it in the top 5 cryptos.",1636636951,hk76i5x
"This narrative that somehow Superstonk is a GME sub was lost over the last two months of Computershare spam.  

ANY DISCUSSION outside of that I welcome.  LRC makes perfect sense to be discussed here",1636636903,hk76euf
I own xxx GME and xxx LRC. I see them as a classic 80’s tag team getting ready to drop something nasty off the top rope.,1636636672,hk75yol
"Loopring has what's called a ""smart wallet"", which has built in protections to recover the contents if lost or stolen. This is pretty big for crypto, to my understanding. 

The wallet is currently available for a fee, because it costs gas to create. Gas costs run $100 - $200 at present. Once you create it though, L2 on LRC is gas free. To my understanding, that's the biggest draw. 

The free one is what's called a counterfactual wallet. It gives you a ""try before you buy"" option strictly for L2 purposes (gas free transactions). I don't know if it's as secure as the smart one, but once your confidence or usage or contained amount is at a level where it's beneficial to you to have access to L1 you can pay for the smart wallet and access L1. 

They are planning to release this counterfactual wallet this quarter. It's a pretty big deal.",1636636608,hk75ujf
Where do you see the price going on lrc?  People on lrc sub saying 50$ plus seems insane to me... but I'm a stupid mother fucker,1636636540,hk75pz1
Great for GME stock but am I the only one here that’s saying sell on LRC?   Folks it’s 5X in the last two weeks “buy the rumor sell on the news”.  Don’t see the upside on LRC after a formal announcement from GME. Plus what’s the recent history of announcements anyway??  The rumors made it go up 5X setup from here is down not up IMO,1636636096,hk74whj
"Lrc is like distraction kryptonite to apes.

Lrc has no squeeze
Lrc has strong rumors of some sort of collab or partnership with GME",1636636017,hk74r8e
"I hope so because right now all my LRC is only half enough to open a wallet.

If LRC moons, I'll be able to finally get inside.",1636635953,hk74mya
"You are probably being down-voted for stating ""facts"" without backing anything up with evidence.

Also, LRC *is* a layer 2 zkrollup, so it sounds like you need more education on the topic. Source: https://loopring.org/#/

Also, crying for the Mods to remove posts makes you sound like a shill. 

That's why you're being down-voted.

&gt;",1636635591,hk73yx4
One of reasons I bought some LRC was to have some spicy community time again. Superstonk is a bit stale lately (which isn't bad) due to how zen we all are and the frequency of CS posts. I miss the memes.,1636635457,hk73qgk
When a potential ownership is announced people can still buy LRC then. As of right now why not just buy and DRS GME?,1636635383,hk73lum

"I am personal at a point of maximum ability to buy more GME for what my level of tolerance financially is. I’ve strictly bought GME since March 10th. Roth is all in, DRS’d most of it. I’ve maxed myself out in a fraudulent system and I’m glad to see other still able to buy GME, it’s my main focus by a long shot. But I’ve bought GME starting at $346/ share and seeing LRC AT .40 made this investment something I could try and is hopefully tied to GME. It’s not all just black and white, all or none here. Some have seen gains for almost a year, others are still waiting to see green in their accounts, like myself. There are as many ways to approach this as their are types of people in the investment world.

* Point Seventy-Poo &amp; Shitadel are big/long with CB
* Apparently CB was/is having liquidity issues in regards to the amount of LRC they had on hand
* People were posting earlier today and yesterday that when trying to pull their LRC off exchange (CB) their transactions were being essentially frozen and were stuck in a pending state for 13+ hours at that point based on some of the comments I was coming across
* People have been monitoring CB's LRC wallet and watching apes chew steadily through their new liquidity pool as they keep trying to pull their LRC off chain and essentially DRS their LRC
* These frozen transactions were starting to cause thoughts of whether CB can be trusted and feelings of PTSD / flashbacks to robbinghood and that infamous day when the buy button was disabled
* The synthetic part refers to the fact that you can sit there and buy LRC on CB without any problem but the second you tried to pull more than a small test tx amount off the exchange? Peoples transactions were frozen in place
* **UNTIL AN ASSET IS IN YOUR POSSESION, IT IS NOT ACTUALLY YOURS AND THEY ARE JUST NUMBERS IN YOUR ACCOUNT**
* I got curious if this was still an issue and decided to offload a few thousand LRC from CB and I was able to get them off exchange in about 5 - 10 minutes",1637904526,hm4g35t

Nothing about lrc is speculative it has a real use case that solves a problem that’s stopping gme from creating the nft market place. High gas fees. If vitalik the creator of ethereum thinks lrc is the answer I’m go with that,1638045266,hmbd5kt
"The thing is with out GameStop lrc is still the best coin to do what gme needs in a nft marketplace. Even the creator of ethereum is bullish on lrc’ slayer two capabilities. So like rc said. talk is cheap, it takes money to buy ehiskey",1638045159,hmbcwaz
Bruh the creator of ethereum and the main investor in Ryan Cohen Larry Chang have all alluded to it. I was extremely skeptical till I did my own research. The dev team of lrc was real quick to clarify when someone posted fake rumors about the GitHub code. But a week before that when the gme rumors happened they stayed quiet. There’s to much info pointing directly to lrc. But at the end of the day gme is my biggest holding and I’m not selling till kennnys in a cell. This is just bullish information on how gme will accomplish the nft marketplace they’ve been talking about,1638045056,hmbcnk4
"I got the same vibes, it feels like OP doesn't know that LRC is a token as they're referring to it as a security. They also have clearly no idea what it does or why it might be good to be invested in it in addition to GME, or why it might BENEFIT GameStop to have liquidity providing apes in LRC.

""" Business and STOCKS"" notice the S on the end of that word. That means plural, I don't think there's more than one stock for gme so it would lead you to believe that discussion of others is allowed depending on if it is related to gme in some way.. 

Specifically means different things depending on the context, in the context of the sub description one could think it means in someway related to gme. Which loopring definitely is at this point. We aren't exactly sure how LRC will be relevant, speculation would point to lrc being used for transactions with the loopring wallet and for minting NFTs on their platform which is heavily speculated to be what their marketplace will enable. It's either LRC or ETH that will be needed to burn to mint NFTs and I would put my money on it being LRC. That's pretty relevant if gme is going to start a marketplace with loopring to mint and trade NFTs. 

Everyone should be aware of scams not sure what that has to do with anything though. Personally I haven't seen any though and I spend more time than I should on this sub and others.

Not a flex just saying I've been around and understand the type of forum sliding that has been on gme subs and this ain't it. 

The fact that the head of Blockchain has said he is still hodling his lrc is a huge reason why it shouldn't be frowned upon. You can think whatever you want but your inability to be open-minded and engage in discussion is something you may want to reflect on.",1638042759,hmb71np

But (prepared for downvotes) if we are to be realistic and we take the prices of LRC and GME as of today, see which one would yield a greater return if we don't touch it for 5 years...

I think people confuse Loopring with LRC. Talk !

Not sure why I’m being downvoted… I have (mostly) ?

Im not an expert on ramp, BUT I do know quite a ?!

###### in v420.X I became self-aware...🚀[MOAR DRSBOT:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qap4je/drsbot_4x_now_online/)🚀",1638030716,hmaehsy
"Loopring network fees can be paid using any token, but preferential rates are given for using LRC specifically. That incentivizes GME to hold LRC to reduce operational costs especially if they’re going to use Loopring for a rewards program where costs aren’t passed along to customers, only rewards are.

Even if GameStop creates their own token every transaction deflates LRC due to the smart contract built in burn rate. 

&gt;	A.3 Introducing the LRC Burn Rate
With this in mind, we have introduced a fee element, LRC burn rate (or burn rate). Wallets and ring-miners who earn fees by fulfilling roles on the Loopring protocol will have a portion of their fees converted into LRC (if not LRC already) and burned.

[Bullish on LRC](https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf)",1638030391,hmadrvc
"GS needs a wallet with a fiat on ramp, Loopring provides this for free. Thats why they simply partnered with LRC instead of reinventing the wheel.",1638030258,hmadh9u
"This.

LRC is getting Pumped, will be dumped. So too bad for those that fall for it.

But misappropriating the images of others, like shown in the OP, is disgusting.",1638029889,hmacntx
Funny how lrc isn't listen on robinthehood,1638029608,hmac1ow
"There was a point in time where the popcorn shilling was so egregious, but eventually I found out it was a reverse psychology shilling, by making it look so bad that people stayed away, and then it popped.

But the LRC people are truly trying to make it seem like a legit thing, and that's the main difference.",1638029281,hmabbgx
"For whom? Only people already holding LRC. 

There is no legitimate business reason for GameStop to use LRC, vs. a licensing of any patented technology (should any patents actually survive challenges) and rolling their own. 

If GameStop is going to do this right as a business, and I feel they will, they will make sure to have full control of the platform, including these secondary tokens.",1638029190,hmab4b3
"Yep.  Talk ComputerShare direct purchase or buying via Fidelity and IEX if they are experienced with stocks.  And, then once the hook is set, tell them about DRSing to Computershare!!!

Also, if dealing with crypto junkies, tell them about loopring (LRC)",1638028893,hmaagzh
"If GME was going to buy out Loopring, the fools on this sub pushing LRC just made the acquisition ridiculously more expensive in the last couple months. This is a GME sub. Wish people would stop talking about buying LRC.",1638028804,hmaa9xz
"See a whole lot of pumping around the LRC token, and not around the technology behind level 2s, etc. The great thing about crypto is that it is infinitely easy to clone, its the adoption that is difficult. There is zero benefit to GameStop for them to base it upon existing LRC.",1638028752,hmaa5xc
"Imagine Coinbase (if your familiar). I want to buy LRC now, I’ll go to Coinbase and use my debit card or bank account to purchase. There’s a lot I can do with the LRC but if I want to buy something in the real world I’ll need to transfer that back to your local currency. So back to Coinbase I go to get an exchange into USD and then transfer back to my bank account. 
Now, as far as I can see it. We skip Coinbase completely. Instead, we’ll link our accounts or debit cards to the wallet through loopring fiat on ramp (whoever the processor ends up being). But ultimately FOR NOW we will have to transfer back to our bank account for real world stuff. 

BUT I have been super excited about all of this. This could be the beginning to Web 3.0 meaning this marketplace could directly link to business that decide to do business there like Walmart or Home Depot or whatever…. We already know GameStop will be there. For those that have connected to the marketplace we can use the marketplace currency which could be LRC or a 1-1 Gamecoin equivalent to purchase real world things right there in the marketplace without having to go to the store to whip out that awesome plastic card. Then there could be daily or two day shipping. Imagine our box stores changing to basically shipping warehouses. Because we eventually buy more on marketplaces like this one instead of actually going to the store. 

I dunno I’m super jacked for the future in general  but of course the immediate future will be insane. BUY HODL DRS SHOP!!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌒🌒🌒🌒",1638028692,hmaa16w
"Only reason I’m in on it is so I can do some Christmas shopping and take care of some things around the house  since everything I got is in GME. I understand bitching about LRC posts, but to bitch about people being invested in LRC kind of irks me. Not everything is FUD.",1636559811,hk2xcj1
"Rookie LRC participant here as of Monday evening, but I used Coinbase and pulled cash from JPMorgan",1636559718,hk2x4at
No one cares if you own LRC or popcorn or whatever - except for you and others like you. Keep it to yourself thank you very much.,1636559664,hk2wziq
"Fuck off LRC is GME adjacent, people buying LRC are hyped for the partnership, which is all but announced. Stop advocating for wild censorship, not everything is a shill ploy to get us to sell gamestop.",1636559601,hk2wtt0
"I disagree. Talking about Loopring and the partnership is fine, LRC is 100% unrelated to GME.",1636559475,hk2whdl
"No one is pumping DRS as a thing to invest in independently of GME, people promote DRS as the means for owning the shares of GME that you purchase rather than it being on someone else's books. Please inform me and this thread how owning LRC translates to ownership of GAMESTOP. It doesn't. Posts about Loopring COIN do not belong on GME. Discussions about how the technology behind Loopring can be utilized by Gamestop to advance its business endeavors are welcome, but discussions about investing money into a coin that will in no way advance Gamestop's business are not.",1636559353,hk2w8x9
"I beg to differ. The rise of their token price is indicative of affirmation of their technology and potential, which is why we hired Finestone and why GameStop is in the most recent source code commits. It is real. 

Secondly, as a supporter or our little brother stock, I got in early and it is still early imo. Where do you think the tendies are going to? This thing has been an 8-bagger over the past two weeks. 8 x multiple with no signs of slowing down. It is our future. It is defi and et-h future. And how do you think [nft.gamestop.com](https://nft.gamestop.com) is going to work? 

Nothing wrong with talking about how they are trending. In fact, it's how we would be trending without all the market fuckery and suppression. And speaking of suppression, I disagree with banning discussion of LRC. I do agree with banning of posting gains though. Not cool to do that. 

Hopefully a Mod sees this opinion before all the us vs. them shit starts flying. Cheers.",1636559168,hk2vsau
That's exactly what I did with the earn lessons on Coinbase. My $8 of LRC is already worth $20,1636559028,hk2vfhz
"They would never give us 1 LRC,  they would give us an nft with no physical value, so that they have to figure how to get that, instead of just throwing cash out there.",1636558949,hk2v86a
"I'd have gotten into it, if one of my existing brokers would sell it to me.   Also though, my reason would have been to buy in low, and sell...(soon I suppose?) to buy more GME, ideally in time for MOASS.  Trick is that timing it is not realistic.  So, more likely, I'd have bought into it and missed MOASS with those funds (though still, gotten like 700% payoff, so far, from when it hit the top of my radar).

Personally, I look at the rise of LRC and see it as confirmation bias for GME.  You're telling me that the rumor of LRC partnering with GME and bla bla bal - they rocket up 700%+ in a couple weeks, while gamestop itself goes up a small fraction of that?  Seems sus AF to me.  I just don't believe the shorts can hold GME back forever.",1636558949,hk2v862
"If the announcement lines up with expectations…current expectations are insanely high.  I’m sure I’ll get downvoted, and I have LRC…but right now our theories for what the NFT marketplace will be are very lucrative.  If that doesn’t pan out then it will drop pretty quickly.

Krypto is super fickle…so I’m looking to move those a lot of gains to GME this week, while GME is trading at the $200 fake price.",1636558912,hk2v4dq
"Agree 100% 

LRC/Loopring is going to be heavily important to GME at this point.  Don't understand why we wouldn't support those discussions.  Rather hear about stuff like that, than the 10,000th shitpost adding no useful information.",1636558911,hk2v48v
"Diverting money away from GME doesn’t hurt us at all. This battle isn’t going to be won by pumping more and more money into GME. 
I have 40 shares and I’m not putting another cent into GameStop, I’m putting it all into LRC now.",1636558861,hk2uz6x
"If you're trying to make a correlation between LRC price and GME price well...LRC is rising and GME is falling. Great look for LRC I suppose, not a great look for GME, the subject of this particular subreddit.",1636558860,hk2uz08
Why? What did I miss? There's a squeeze for LRC?,1636558757,hk2uphh
"Yea, the shills are trying to weasel in lrc token price / gain porn under the guise of “but you allow xxx”. Those xxx posts relate to the stability of the market and thus gme.  Lrc token price has NOTHING to do with gme / loop ring tech used for gme nft.  Unless I’m missing some fd somewhere that connects the price.",1636558752,hk2up2n
or maybe because lrc was at .90 like 5 days ago and is at 3.60 now? would that matter to someone trying to profit off investments?,1636558739,hk2unux
Ive basically 10x my LRC in like 3 weeks.,1636558687,hk2ujbf
I have already 7x the money I invested a week ago into it. That money will be going to buying GME after this coin stops ripping this week. Nice to be able to afford at least 7x more GME so quickly because someone said something about it on this sub explaining it's relation to GME. Would you prefer I show a graph correlation on how my gain porn off LRC impacted the amount of GME I could buy? Cuz a story off how I was able to afford 10x more GME is still about GME.,1636558670,hk2uht0
"If there is a nft dividend it’s going to be a nft, not lrc or other coin/token. Lrc is a layer 2 solution to eth. It provides the trucks on the highway that is eth if you will. A means to distribution not an endgoal in and of itself.",1636558668,hk2uhkw
"I have not seen any speculation that gamestop is considering giving a dividend of one LRC per share.  LRC, as I understand it, is rumored to be creating a marketplace and perhaps helping gamestop create it's own NFT resource (read, 'coin'), that may be given out 1:1 to shareholders as a dividend.  That coin would not be the same as one LRC coin.",1636558661,hk2uh07
LRC is providing liquidity to help bolster GME holders’ resolve. They work together. Like chocolate and peanut butter.,1636558660,hk2ugun
Same here. I just stopped in over there to ask some questions. They are all super nice so far and welcome gme apes! I just want to leave a subreddit for a discussion about THAT thing. Get that LRC out of my GME talk,1636558591,hk2uaqc
Every lrc thread has commenters jumping in about their lrc gains,1636558564,hk2u8al
How do I buy lrc!?!?,1636558522,hk2u4h1
LRC wallet (hella expensive) looks like it offers staking and LP action.,1636558434,hk2twji
"It’s okay to have investments on the side imo. Yes, GME is the one true play but there’s nothing wrong with getting money in the short term. 

I’ve 5x my LRC investment in just a week. If it moons before GME guess where the proceeds are going? Right back into GME..",1636558313,hk2tlyx
"No squeeze play on LRC? Not for me then. I think LoopRing is great and all, but my $$$ is going to GME.",1636558244,hk2tfvr
"my  question is:

What blocks SHF's to now pump LRC to get prepared for a possible dividend? If everyone of us gets 1 LRC per share it's super cheap to avoid MOASS by now buying tons of that coin for a few bucks each. And they don't need to cover neither.

Do I miss something?",1636558229,hk2teib
"It's not out of the DTC.  It's still in the DTC, under a different name.  It has no effect on the price of the stock.  It's not forcing a squeeze by locking up the float.  It has no function other than to put your name on it and make a post to farm karma.

LRC, on the other hand, is a functional token that's likely a partner of what will be the biggest NFT marketplace on the internet.  Get hyped   if you retarders had any sense about you, you'd have been digging in and buying weeks ago instead of promoting your ridiculous DRS narrative.",1636558160,hk2t8as
LRC is but a small mini game compared to the Moass,1636558078,hk2t0w1
"It is okay to have multiple investments. And buying some lrc is not very expensive. And if it moons first you know those proceeds will return to our beloved gme.

That being said, I don't think we need lrc graphs, charts, and non partnership updates in this sub.",1636558077,hk2t0t3
Where do you even buy LRC can’t find it on any of my brokerage apps,1636558027,hk2swef

"Because if and when GameStop goes to blockchain, which it will, you have 100% control of your assets within loopring. Not just the wallet. The actual assets. DRS but digital style. Again. Read the DD. Which you won’t. But I did. And again. It’s a digital version of ComputerShare. Only difference is there isn’t a network of people or a corporation there to help you. YOU are in 100% control. 

Where have I heard that before l? Ah yes. ComputerShare. 

Now. Speaking strictly of the GME situation. It won’t pull from the DTCC but the gains to be made will help considering ALL of my gains in LRC will go to GME

Why wait two weeks for a paycheck to buy more GME, when I could invest in other ways to have more flexibility when buying GME. It’s crazy that some of you would rather grind at work.",1636557939,hk2sooa

"why, then why are purple circles allowed to stuff up the sub and not LRC?",1636557910,hk2sm2e
"Same here, i have less than 1% of my holdings in LRC, the rest is GME.  The $300 I put in originally can now buy 10 shares if I sold now.  We know GME is artificially surpressed and price discovery works better in crypto.  When GME moons my LRC will be irrelevant in comparison, BUT if LRC continues on its trend, I can sell some and buy even more GME.",1636557893,hk2skkw
"We’ve been subjected to mental abuse for past months. They used every tactic, and the sticky floor distraction worked well, divided us. Some people who are not shills will unintentionally carry the torch for them. 

Now, LRC is a sound project, but it shouldn’t be discussed here. I know that I felt massive stomach pain when I realised that I bought LRC at 0.90 but only bought a tiny amount. The FOMO is real, but if we truly believe in GME, those 5-10x gains will be a fraction of what we stand to make if we keep holding the line.",1636557855,hk2shc3
"Sounds like a lot of coping and seething going on tbh. 
You won’t complain about drs purple every post for weeks but will about lrc, when it gains..

As for diverting cash from GME, it's my money, I'm an individual investor and I invest in many things.

The price of LRC has nothing to do with GME? That’s something someone who has tunneled would say. Check out their discord. Check out their sub. Obviously you won’t. You’d be surprised how much the price has to do with GME considering most of the newer holders are GME apes.,1636557050,hk2qgdt
"Gain posts is what I'm specifically referencing. DD of any sort is related and allowed. Gain post induce FOMO, one way or the other, and can only serve as a distraction.

"Sure, but none of that matters until the MOASS happens anyways. 

All money is better spent DRSing GME, period. Then when/if you get your NFT dividends, you’ll have a crypto that’s either already loopring or worth millions of loopring, on top of the millions of tendies you get from MOASS that you can just use to buy LRC if you want. 

Until then, DRS GME is the only path to the MOASS and any other waste of money into other cryptos or memes is stupid and nobody can change my fucking mind.",1636556736,hk2ppxl
"I’m situationally for banning LRC posts if that also includes Evergrande, reverse repo, and inflation posts because they are less related to GME then LRC. At least LRC has a link to GME everything else is just hoping for a market crash which may or may not help GME as most big banks and hedge funds have probably already planned for the inevitable market crash and have been making a shit ton of money on the bubble which they have likely already been slowly funneling out of the market while passing bags to retail holders and bulls.",1636556703,hk2pn2z

Lrc isn’t a shit coin even without gme. Do you dd stop spewing bullshit,1636554883,hk2less

Inflation is not linked to GME.

Evergrande is not linked to GME.

Bury is not linked to GME.

I can understand how a market crash *could* lead to small HFs going under which *may* force larger HFs to close short postions which *possibly* include short GME positions.

Inflation or Evergrande *may possibly* be an indicator of a such a market crash...

But at this point we are like 3 or 4 degrees of speculative separation from GME with those topics.  LRC is 1 degree of speculative separation from GME.

I think the forum has been slid hard with all these topics. 

TL;DR **I personally don't care about if LRC discussion is allowed or not -- but I am keen to you get your opinion on the other topics that are commonly discussed here.**",1636570170,hk3o0sd

"Maybe. Of course, any mention of doubting shills are around every corner makes me a shill right? that's why I don't buy into any of the fear based shit at all. I refuse to see the world as an orchestrated thing. Reality just isn't like that imo. Humans basically can't do anything in an effective and coordinated way. That sucks, because we can't do important and good things, but it's also a buffer against any organized attempt to do bad things. 

Also, if you look at popular posts, you have ones saying ""ban all mention or lrc"" and getting thousands of upvotes. Some people are just blind about crypto and don't want to hear it. Many on this sub are completely clueless about crypto. Stocks are their thing and they still view crypto as if it's not real. The crypto subs on reddit are even worse lol. People are just generally idiots. 

You are not wrong to believe in lrc, I do too. I see it as offering real value as a core technology, one that has an excellent chance for long term adoption in the fabric of blockchain techologies, which collectively will form the entire backbone of web 3.0 and our technological future. Most people just don't have the perspective to even discuss this stuff.",1636569902,hk3nbqt

"“I don't see how allowing someone to buy what they were going to buy can be described as market manipulation”

Why did you use the word allow? This isn’t the right verb at all. You said that others might not buy GME after seeing others post about LRC gains, and implied that this is the very reason why these posts need to not be allowed.

What you are not “allowing”, if anything, is others to make their own decisions because you think their opinion is fragile and needs to be guided towards GME or not distracted away.",1636569576,hk3mhe6
"I know, but you’re not a shill. My question is whether or not the leak was actually a legitimate accident or did someone else push it for forum sliding and or maybe as a way to make money from the crypto getting pumped?

These are questions that we need to be asking here. I own LRC and DRS GME as well, but the lack of new posts on superstonk has been alarming to me. Then again, I also believe in the gme thesis and I don’t have much need to find something new, whereas it has been fun to watch LRC so it might not be some devious force behind it. I just have to ask the question because ive been watching since January and there is a new shill attack every few weeks so I’m like ok, where is the latest shill attack? 

It’s also possible that shills have just been taking advantage of LRC situation in an effort to get people to sell. I really wish they would just announce the partnership already.",1636569471,hk3m7j2
Jesus fck lrc spam is out of control. Please BAN lrc UNTIL Gamestop makes official announcement. Plz thank you.,1636569227,hk3lkrh
Personally I feel like it’s more likely shills are spamming LRC in the sub to keep everyone from reading about this tech. The automated market maker system Will put Shitadel out of business in the long run once it is adopted more broadly. They know we are paranoid and they are using it against us.,1636569220,hk3lk6i

If someone wants to say I bought XX more thanks to another investment thats fine. In my opinion.",1636568601,hk3jyac
"I believe in the tech, but I am legitimately concerned that the leak was pushed by someone that had an agenda. I’ve noticed that every single LRC started to pump, superstonk posts have dwindled to like 1/5th of their previous numbers. 

Is the reason why because they want apes to sell their shares? I saw some ludicrous comment talking about people selling their DRS for LRC, which is nonsense. No one is fucking doing that, but if enough shills write the question of whether or not that is the case, maybe their goal is to freak out people enough to sell? 

I’m diamond hands. So I don’t even care, for me I’m just hodling until my balance hits a certain amount. Or I hodl for rest of my life. But I do wonder about the state of the superstonk union with LRC posts.",1636568342,hk3j9vu
"Holy. Fucking. Shit. Are you that dense? 

Do you want an NFT dividend? Do you know one of the reasons people say to DRS? It’s literally to be able to get an NFT fucking dividend. 

What about NFT.GameStop.com, how do you think that’ll work? Probably through Looprings NFT marketplace. And if that’s the case, guess how you most likely get paid when selling your NFT. YEP, with fucking LRC!

"I have seen several times as many posts complaining about the mention of LRC than I have seen posts about LRC.  It's getting ridiculous. Just downvote and move on.  If the MODS were going to ban mention of LRC they would have by now.  They are aware of it, they will ban it if they choose.  It's getting annoying, the constant paranoia and attitude that if absolutely any mention of money spent on anything besides shares of GME between now and MOASS is ""aGaiNsT thE rULeS"".  

Toys for tots? Fuck you buy more GME!  LRC? Fuck you!  Groceries besides ramen? Fuck you!

By this logic, take all mention of Fidelity to the Fidelity sub.  DRS?  Take it to the Computershare sub.  GameStop?  Take it to their sub.  Loopring?  You guessed it.

Maybe LRC coins will be used in GameStop's marketplace, maybe they won't.  But, it's disingenuous to act as if the fact that LRC is the official coin of the company we all know will be running GameStop's marketplace ""is a distraction"".  I have the ability to remember to DRS as well as be curious about Loopring's coin.  You know how I found out about LRC initially and decided to pick some up?

All Loopring provides is the marketplace + UI app, NOT the Loopring protocol (open source) or web3 interface. If you believe GameStop is working on a marketplace it is in direct conflict with the belief GameStop is using Loopring's market place.

"Sell.  You mean sell.  The entire point of an NFT is that it's *non-fungible*.  This means it's impossible for two people to own (have access to) it at the same time.  

An NFT game would basically be the equivalent of a product key like we have today.  The difference is that your unique key could be bought and sold as you see fit, and there would always be a traceable, permanent and verifiable record of every transaction where it's bought and sold.  But only one person could use the key at a time.  Want someone else to use your key?  You have to sell it and now you no longer can use it.

If the NFT held a hash of the binaries (rather than an index into an IPFS share) then you could even download your game.  Everyone could download it.  But only those who own a valid NFT could decode the binaries.

I don't mean to be rude, but this subreddit seems to have a depth of understanding of NFTs and blockchain comparable to a layer of dust on a book shelf.  GameStop hasn't announced anything at all.  They seem to be working with LRC on *something* but we literally have no clue what.  For all we know it could be an NFT collection of fortnight stickers.

"&gt;An NFT Marketplace with a standard ""LRC"" coin would be amazing. It would stifle certain developers though who think they need to have their own coin.

IMO more likely it'll just use regular currency on the platform - I bet you'll buy your NFT with regular USD on a credit card or whatever, as far as you the user sees. They gotta make it so the user doesn't need to know anything at all about crypto or currency trading, otherwise there's just unnecessary barriers to mainstream adoption. All the crypto/blockchain stuff will be entirely behind the scenes I reckon.",1640473604,hpyq4rj
"So if you're old enough to remember that, you're also old enough to remember things like ""virtual boy"" and all the other ""revolutionary products"". 

&amp;#x200B;

The tech might ""sell itself"" on utility; but its just like VR in that if you ham fist the approach, you make it so that the general public looks and laughs, and then developers say ""oh well, we aren't going to hire a crypto programmer just to add NFT's, when adding NFT's drops our sales by 25+ % "". 

&amp;#x200B;

NFT's have already been associated with greed, poor development cycles, and piss poor gameplay. I do not see this changing in the next ""cycle"" of games coming out supporting crypto/crypto transactions either; I have watched the ""hype"" coming out of the sector and its.. not real. It's not shared by people who are outside of the circle. Look at STALKER 2; look at how their developers IMMEDIATELY walked back their NFT decision, and even after they did; look at how many people have said ""oh. Well since you've even bothered considering NFT's we're not going to buy your game"". Does that suck? Hell yea. Is that fair? Hell no. But when money's tight, and there are a billion choices for games, its truly a market of ""if you fuck up you're forgotten"", and its the reality of the developers world. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where I get on my soap box: Gamers are tired of being treated like dog shit, and tired of getting squeezed for every dime. You aren't going to convince them that ""market places"" are in their favor, because historically they never are. And if your marketplace allows for shitcoins, and shitcoin based games, then even though it's decentralized its still ripe for predation by the company making the games, and by scalpers who scrape data and force artificial scarcity.  

&amp;#x200B;

But enough pointing out the actual issues; let me make for a fair argument and give you a list of ways that you'll get proper developers on board (and not just shitcoin developers who are looking to make a quick buck and cash out). 

1. Singular standard of transaction. Just use LRC. No fuckin letting other companies step in and mint like.. ""halo coin"" or something. No allowing outside value. Punish developers who are attempting to purposefully harm ""investments"" made by gamers.  
2. Strict rules and regulations about quality of content allowed to be placed on the market place. The ""lazy monkey"" NFT's are not actually properly implemented in any way. They are a smart contract that references a web 2.0 server, and if the server goes down the actual contents of the smart contract do not work. You must enforce proper use of smart contracts and decentralization. 
3. Strict rules and regulations about scalping, and about data scraping. Proper enforcement of anti-bot policies. It does my company no good to make a ""gorillion dollars"" if my players did not actually get to enjoy the content. 

&amp;#x200B;

The above things were just a few things that were brought up during my team's assessment of NFT's as a whole. We considered adding them to our game (it would have been appropriate), and ultimately came to the conclusion that without the above 3 features, NFT's are a toxic minefield, and are actively going to harm any game's reputation that implements them.",1640472657,hpyo908

"So, my understanding is equally low-level, but afaik LRC's plan is to eliminate regular fees for the ETH transactions (via a number of technobabble means) so that normal users aren't penalized just for engaging with the market.

This means just holding your tokens costs nothing, buying a token or selling a token may only carry a small fee from the platform you buy/sell through, but ultimately the back-end is zero or extremely low fee...

Likewise, your tokens are *forever* verifiable against the back-end blockchain network (in this case ETH, but I imagine the ledger itself has some hooks from LRC/partner platform that ensures that it can be migrated to other chains should the need arise with minimal risk to the actual participants. This would be the only way to fully trust LRC's promises and ultimately trust any ""game marketplace"" that relies on these tokens... it would have to be specifically coin/chain agnostic so that the rises and falls of the various code bases aren't catastrophic to regular customers.

I imagine that's a future goal, as right now they're just trying to launch for ETH and the promises of ""partners"" sounds to me like there's no short term risk of the underlying tokens and ledgers being abandoned/lost because it would be financially destructive to their entire model.",1640469046,hpygyon

In MEtaVerse, a BOT could snap up ALL collectibles of older games/titles or even current games/titles and create false scarcity on items propping their values up. That could effectively halt progress on a popular game if a bot ends up buying 99/100 new fortnite skins, and NO one wants to play the game anymore.

- news of his scheme breaks

I don't know where you're getting the ""you need 50 LRC as a minimum deposit"" from. Even your instructions of ""ETH on LoopRing"" is for a purchase order of ETH, not LRC.

But for Step 4, the Loopring Wallet App gave me TWO choices to set up my L2.  

Option 1 is Buy with card: it leads you to the RAMP page WITHIN the app with a minimum order value of $100.56 with only 2 asset choices. ETH on LoopRing, or USDC on LoopRing.  

Option 2 is what your post shows. You use your Wallet address. You can head over to RAMP on a browser and the minimum order value is lower (around $60) but shows me higher fees. You can select both assets mentioned above for Option 1

Both options use RAMP to deposit into L2. I selected ""ETH on LoopRing"" like your post says and made an order above the minimum. Then I did the KYC process. I was then sent an email to complete my transaction. My total fees were around 5-6%.

My wallet is showing my balance on L2 with a fractional amount of ETH and 0 balance for LRC. L1 is not activated.
When I click on ""trade"" in the LoopRing wallet app, it shows an ""Activate"" button, which means I would need to activate L1 to do any trading.",1640419595,hpwcoxo

"You’re right, this is a GME sub! 

Personally, I bought 400 lrc a couple of days ago, mainly because I’m still waiting for my CS snail mail confirmation and am super hesitant to buy more GME on the open market (am a XXX holder in Germany). And I’m sitting on quite some cash since I’ve been waiting for the CS mail for 5 weeks now. My thinking was quite simple: If apes are right and loopring actually announces an NFT marketplace collaboration with GameStop, then lrc should soar. In theory, it should be quite a bit more difficult for SHFs to suppress the price of a token than suppressing the price of GME, they have years of experience with that shit by now. So my thinking was: maybe LRC soars even before MOASS, giving me additional funds to by more GME once my CS registration comes through. And given the fact that lrc is super cheap, I could buy 400 for the amount of 1 GME share. 
And ye, this is the GME sub, but all hints and therories regarding NFT link GME and lrc pretty convincingly, so I don’t see the issue with people talking about lrc a bit.

"I’m asking the mods to clarify/enforce the rules about pushing crypto. Talking about Loopring is fine. Pushing their crypto is not. 

Being controlled by the hedgies is the extreme end of the possibilities, but Loopring could be doing those exact things on their own to pump their own brand if they do not have an actual GME connection. Pump and dumps are a big thing, someone is profiting from apes being convinced buy the LRC coin. Anywhere there is profit, you have to watch for bad actors. I trust RC and GameStop, and they haven’t told me they trust Loopring yet, so I have no reason to trust Loopring yet, and certainly no reason to invest in their coin.",1635772114,hivolo3

"Good luck!   The whole this is so utterly, incomprehensibly stupid the hoops folks have to go through to actually have shares registered in their own name.....

Please feel free to ask any other questions about this, I feel your frustration almost exactly over this.  It really should not have to be this hard. 

A while back I had even gifted my brother some shares (I was trying out how things operated on the Transfer Agent, and it was sooooo hard to get information) and once that started we were both in the dark for WEEKS waiting for them to set up his account with actual snail mail to verify his identity, address etc and THEN set up his password just so he could log in and view HIS actual shares that had already been purchased with settled cash and the trades had already cleared.  Literally weeks.  The compliance hoops they have to go through is insane.

On top of that Transfer Agents can't even ADVERTISE themselves to consumers and companies legally cannot suggest to their OWN shareholders to use transfer agents to directly register shares because of the laws that brokers have set up.

This system needs to go and I hope GME can actually accomplish this.  At least that's where my money is.
(In several brokers and across investing and tax advantaged accounts, in Computershare, in physical certificates - I got lucky...- and in LRC).  I'm NOT trying to miss this train.

Lrc has two announcements imo. We already know they are pulling something crazy off before January 1st when the 4th quarter ends, cool cool. Then we have the ""gamestop lrc combo announcement"" which nobody knows when will happen. That's two chances on a spike and I like those odds.

Seeing as how my entire savings and more is in gme, I would love to be able to get something back from crypto to be able to afford gas to go see family for xmas.

(And I'm asssuming the lrc would cost Gamestop very little because of the partnership that we expect to be launched.) They announce a coming dividend, well, which means LRC may go up and up, and even if the hedgies are able to cover with a cash equivalent, the price of LRC could be 10 times the 2.50 number, say $25 bucks a coin. Come dividend time, brokers/hedgies would have to issue the LRC provided by GameStop or pay every share holder an equivalent cash amount. This seems like a very hard thing to challenge legally. RC could even agree to let brokers cover with cash equivalent and it would still ruin them. WOW. This may be something. If there are 500 million or a billion synthetics out there that could be 12.5 billion or 25 billion they would need to cover JUST in dividends and this assumes the price of LRC stays flat.

ie. GS says they're going to give 1 LRC token for every GME share, and now the hedgies have to buy 1 LRC for every synthetic, the price for LRC therefore climbs and makes it even more expensive for hedgies to buy as it climbs.  

Then GME holders suddenly have LRC holdings in the new marketplace that GME built, and hedgies have effectively paid GME holders to launch it.

After that GS could announce either dividends would continue to be paid out in LRC next quarter, making the price rise even more, or that an NFT dividend is on the way, triggering MOASS.

I like to consider that as it bleeds hedgies of their $$ into ape hands before MOASS even starts.",1638556135,hn3j0oa

"Typically, a press conference is announced by the company through a press release by the company’s PR team to communicate to media for attendance. They can communicate mergers or acquisitions, money moves in the making, changes to executive structures, like big moves that are notable.  They would want the whole world to know.

If it’s not in the News page in the Investors site of GS, and if it’s not picked up by PR news wires for the media to write about and attend, it’s probably not going to happen. 

Who knows though. On the flip side, GS has been a target of spreading misinformation by the media and RC and co knows this so may not even go that route. They can do whatever they want. It’s really interesting because of Ryan’s philosophy in re-building this company without so much as a mutter. There really isn’t any confirmation out there other than what’s been “implied” with LRC and NFT’s. I don’t think the media knows what to think of it either because their main demographics are typically boomers in very sound ETF’s. 

They may also go the route of doing a media conference as opposed to a press conference if it is actually NFT related in order to show a demo of it in action, like 🍎 showing their new iPad’s new capabilities.",1638548956,hn30p5k

As others have noted, currently there is no LRC to Fiat ramp in the L2 wallet. So if you want to convert to Fiat you either wait for the functionality, or you pay a huge gas fee to transfer your LRC from L2 to L1 and then you convert back to Fiat from there.

&gt;I know we're mainly just joking but let me share something that's been on my mind since the 17th:
&gt;So I have a working theory that sets me for the 27th as the possible day of the announcement.

&gt;Back on the 17th RC tweeted the 💩 emoji. That was 20 days to Jan 6th; on Jan 6th 2021, RC tweeted a 💩 emoji and an image of blockbuster. 20 days later was the epic run up where we nearly hit ~$300.

So if all you wanted to do was interact in the Loopring Ecosystem (NFTs / Exchanges / Etc.) then creating a free wallet and linking your bank account for transfers is really all you need.

The real connection here to LoopRing is Matt Finestone. Finestone was the Head of Business at LoopRing, and was on the original development team. Within the past 6 months, he has moved to GameStop as their “Head of Blockchain”. He is still a Top Advisor on the LRC Board, and owns equity in the company as well.

This plus the job posting are 100% confirmations that they will be using Matt’s tech for the Marketplace. Because why would he still be so heavily involved with LRC if they were just going with Polygon or another L2 partner?

"Bro crypto is literally retarded what are you talking about, I have a few thousands in ETH and LRC buy other than that I've never touched crypto. Yes I believe that retail owns less than 40% but I also believe in liquidity scarcity. This is possible if longs and retail both agree that the company is a long term Investment. Longs won't sell if the company has potential which is what will cause the squeeze. VW squeeze had nothing to do with retail but it's because of thr scarcity of the shares.im not telling people to forget about GME, imo it's a great x3/5 long term investment but at this point the squeeze is dead yes. The FOMO is long gone and what is left are long term investors which is great but not what I initially dump 100k on. Y'all are so quick to tell everyone that they are shill because they're not down to wait 12 months for action from the board. In sorry but that's now help you manage a company, they barely acknowledge the naked shorting in their stock and focus on growth. That's good for a company hence why my thesis being a 3/5 investment.

 Shorts haven't covered you say? so what? Nothing has been done from the SEC, FOJ, GME  so what makes it that they can't do it forever? Everyone is talking how a bunch of companies shave been naked shorted to death but aren't doing anything to stop it from happening to GME. It's been 12 months now with no plan, action or even glimpse of evidence to do anything about the manipulation.

Growth is good for investment but not a squeeze which is what everyone here came for. If you says ""well I'm only for GME as a long term investment"" you're coping. It's never been about that, it's always been about the squeeze.",1640556628,hq2neqi

If you want to get your coins onto the Loopring chain to take advantage of the smaller fees, it currently takes a lot of gas fees ($40-100) to do so. This is fine for whales, but hurts wide adoption. Especially if Loopring gets going as an actual payment environment, people will want to put in funds periodically to use.

The fiat on ramp gets around this by selling crypto direct from Loopring's layer-2 chain. They're just a company that sells eth and lrc for cash.

"Hopefully I can help with a summary after reading through some of the comments 

1) The free L2-only wallet is a ""try-before-you-buy"" option with certain limitations. As it stands now, there will eventually be some setup (gas) fees.

2) As others have posted - I'm not clear on this myself - the 50 dollars for the ""free"" wallet is to add funds to the wallet, which is different from the gas fees of setting the wallet up; that fee is temporarily bypassed in order to try the wallet out.

3) The free (L2-only) wallet has some important limitations, specifically security. Loopring uses what they call ""guardian"" security. What that means is you attach other wallets to your Loopring wallet - either wallets you own or that belong to people you trust - which are necessary in order to recover your wallet if you lose your phone, etc. When you initially set up your wallet, the *only* thing connecting you to that wallet is your phone number. So if you're planning on funding the wallet with substantial-to-you funds, you will want to deploy your wallet to L1 (Ethereum mainnet). The way I think of it is it's making your wallet whole. As it stands now, fully deploying your wallet, including guardians, will cost between 100-200 USD and can be paid for in LRC.

4) Transferring existing assets, either from a place like Coinbase or another wallet you own, will require your wallet to be fully deployed and will cost gas. The free L2-only option is really meant to buy (and eventually sell) directly from. There's still a lot of functionality there, but again I'll point out it's a ""try before you buy"" option with limitations.

5) Loopring is calling for places, like Coinbase, to offer a direct L2 bridge to bypass the fees of transferring AND fully deploying your wallet. I don't think this cooperation will happen because it makes it easier for people to leave Coinbase. And Loopring is not profiting off of these gas fees, they're all spent on computational power to create your little slice of the blockchain.

It is confusing and I've tried to learn to help others out. Most of the fees for a fully deployed wallet are a one-time fee. If you like the product and believe in the notion of ""be your own bank,"" think of these as a cost to set up your own organization. And even if you start with the free version, you can fully deploy it at any time to add the security features, etc. And if ""full deployment"" is confusing, it's really just solidifying your wallet on the L1 Ethereum blockchain. This is why the free L2-only option has some limitations, it's kind of a wallet-lite that hasn't quite been completed.

Hope this helps!",1640191232,hpknlk1

It’s recovered by assigning your own two ‘guardian wallets’ and you get assigned a LRC guardian wallet address.

"Wow so it seems like Jacky boy doesn’t want to give up the power he has with the platform he owns. Because here’s the way I see it, if web3 becomes BIG eventually Twitter, Reddit, Facebook all these big players are going to go poof. And this is just my speculation but it feels to me that these guys are all actually scared AF. Maybe not scared, but definitely not sitting comfortably in their seats. It feels to me like they’re trying to secure some form of position before this new rocket takes off. 

Facebook all of a sudden this year after a very damning trial exposing a bunch of precarious behavior, changes their entire direction towards social in the metaverse?? (I still think that whole trial debacle was set up to usher in their new company direction but that’s purely tin foil) Facebook had nothing to do with meta and it all came so quickly out of nowhere. I mean it was obviously just a matter of time but still felt  like a very sudden shift. 

Now Reddit is about to IPO ask yourselves why now of all times??? Just as this huge shift to the metaverse and web3 are going down. I don’t wanna speculate too much but it’s just curious to me. 

And now buddy guy jack wants to hop on Twitter and basically just refute web3 a bunch?? Timing feels very weird if you ask me. Why hasn’t he been saying stuff about web3 all year?? I mean surely the web3 bomb has been ticking all year long. Why choose now of all time’s to go on a Twitter spree against web3. I get that he’s making some decently valid points but he’s really not proving anything about the downsides of web3 with what he’s saying. It just seems like he’s protecting his investments while making some decently valid points about web3.

Eventually when web3 is fully developed there really is going to be absolutely no reason for someone to use a Facebook, a Twitter, or a Reddit when there are other decentralized versions of those sites to use. Why deal with bati boy jack changing your fucking kengriffin hashtag on Twitter web2 when you can just go to a web3 alternative to Twitter. Why deal with censoring on Reddit when eventually there will be a web3 alternative that won’t censor your LRC posts. Why deal with facebook mining your fucking data and selling that shit overseas when you can just use a better web3 alternative. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️

I might be completely off base with what I’m saying lol and that’s okay as long as someone educates me on why I’m wrong lmaoooo 🤙🏽🤙🏽 but to me it seems like a lot of these guys have a fuck ton to lose out from this shift. Unless they adapt and transition over.",1640190167,hpkkyum

"Overstock built a custom exchange called tZero where you could just sign up and claim your blockchain dividend. It was super easy and required zero knowledge of crypto— and that was four years ago. I’ve been wondering why GME didn’t just follow suit and issue their own on tZero but I believe it’s because tZero is now in a joint venture with BSTX and some of the bad guys are part-owners of BSTX.

I set up an LRC wallet just out of curiosity, though I’ve been using L1 exchanges for years now. To echo what another user said above it’s not a user friendly experience and has poor customer support. It makes me bearish on LRC to be honest, and was the only thing in the last year to make me concerned about the upcoming GME marketplace. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still massively bullish on GME but primarily because they have the legal precedent to issue a blockchain divvy and the long term strategic vision to deploy a consumer friendly NFT marketplace. This first iteration of LRC’s wallet though is definitely not that. It’s bare bones and confusing; has English typos in the interface; very poor support for help; and I had to pay around $150 in gas fees to set it up at the time.

The fees depend on how busy the ERC-20 network is at the time you try to set it up. Afternoon/evening in most of the USA seems to be the peak time. Mine was about 18 LRC if memory serves.

"Wording is important. From The Annual Report to Congress from The Office of Financial Research:

&gt; To evaluate the risks that digital assets pose to financial stability, it is useful to distinguish between those whose prices fluctuate freely, such as Bitcoin, and a class of digital assets called stablecoins, which are meant to maintain a constant value relative to an existing currency or asset. For example, market prices of Bitcoin continue to be highly volatile, as illustrated when they fell nearly 40% in one week in May 2021. Such volatility shows that these assets represent a speculative investment rather than an effective means of payment or a store of value.53 As a result, **we refer to Bitcoin and other coins in this first category as crypto assets**. The second category of digital
assets, stablecoins, raise a distinct set of financial stability considerations (see Stablecoins and Central Bank Digital Currencies).

&gt; Some of the large price swings in crypto assets appear to reflect changing expectations about regulation of these assets in different jurisdictions.54 This type of uncertainty may decline as regulatory regimes become more established. However, as with so-called meme stocks, crypto asset prices appear to be particularly vulnerable to social media posts and shifts in investor sentiment (see Social Media-fueled Retail Trading), especially since **most crypto assets have no intrinsic value and generate no cash flow**. In addition, large energy consumption required by some crypto asset protocols have raised environmental concerns that may threaten the long-term viability of these assets.55 

Crypto assets refers to purely speculative crypto investments that have don't serve as effective means of payment, storage of value, or have an intrinsic purpose OTHER than speculation. I don't believe the term Crypto Assets refers to LRC or most other Cryptos that have intrinsic purpose, just those that are purely speculative with no secondary purpose.",1640094960,hpfaa75

LRC to me is a bet on if apes/retail investors in general will move toward Defi after the curtain has been completely pulled on the stock market. Loopring seems to be dedicating themselves to making the shinest most clean red carpet ever to roll out for apes on the road to Defi.

"741 thought: Seven LRC for every single share seems like a brilliant idea to me. Maybe a smarter ape has to check my thought process, but if they set aside 7 LRC for each share and lock up the LRC at $2.50. (And I'm assuming the lrc would cost GameStop very little because of the partnership that we expect to be launched.) They announce a coming dividend, well, which means LRC may go up and up, and even if the hedgies are able to cover with a cash equivalent, the price of LRC could be 10 times the 2.50 number, say $25 bucks a coin. Come dividend time, brokers/hedgies would have to issue the LRC provided by GameStop or pay every share holder an equivalent cash amount. This seems like a very hard thing to challenge legally, especially the way Overstock shook out. RC could even agree to let brokers cover with cash equivalent and it would still ruin them. WOW. This may be something. If there are 500 million or a billion synthetics out there that could be 12.5 billion or 25 billion they would need to cover JUST in dividends and this assumes the price of LRC stays flat.

"PSA:

Downvotes are all the proof we need to know all the LRC shills are right here. The gaslighting is humorous.

""Show proof or shut up about it"" have a taste of your own medicine. Show me the misinformation. I'll be happy to read through it. 


Can't believe I have to explain this to you... They are connected because Matt Finestone is involved. There has been speculation that they two companies will partner up but regardless if that happens or not, there is still a connection. Wanna know how I know?  Because when the first hint dropped of a partnership, apes like me were smart enough to hop on and invest in LRC. Why would you be so salty about people making gains? Maybe it's because you're jealous you missed that flight in the beginning? Plenty of apes have made gains and have reinvested those gains for the reason we're all here for.

"My opinion is that while loopring and LRC aren’t *exactly* the same. LRC comes *from* loopring, and any monumental success from loopring could trickle down to LRC. It’s practically verified that loopring is partnering with GME so they’re both going to explode when this thing takes off(it’s also a lot cheaper to buy a whole coin here than it is with that other coin that blasted off years ago, and I have a feeling that LRC will do the same. It’s also not a bad first coin to get into with the abstract relation of  LRC &gt; Loopring &gt; GME

Of course, I have no experience in the coin side of things, so this could either go amazingly or horribly for this investment. 

Honestly, GME is *a* play, probably one of the best ones there is for squeeze potential and long term investment, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other plays out there, and it’s up to each individual to choose if they want to diversify",1640021163,hpbeqc2

The thoughts that got me to buy \~$100 worth of LRC:  


\-  MOASS will be held down until the very last moment  
\-  An NFT marketplace announcement alone likely won't trigger MOASS

"My thought process is: Oh this meme stock diluted 500% and still went up 5x, that means GME is actually 25x behind. BBBY went up 2x, so GME is now 50x behind. Oh look LRC went up 5x, GME is now 250x behind. And so on ... you get the gist. I ain't selling until the price catches up to all the good GME news since January",1636461614,hjxgccf

Anyone that plays with ethereoum gas fees will learn about lrc soon enough apes would pump it and talk a lot about it and as it gains traction it appears on top of crypto pages and snowball even more, that and the fact that it haves a low float (i dont know how to translate the term from my languaje but i mean that there wasnt much money put into the coin so it can grow exponentially easyly).

"For the apes that might not know HODL is a crypto meme/term. It comes from a drunken post made by GameKyuubi on the bitcoin talk forum on December 18, 2013.

"Take 1 minute lessons and they pay you in crypto... I had $40 worth of a handful of coins, liquidated them and bought LRC.",1636441523,hjwrdtw
"Since February as you, my avg buy in is 153$. I take all extra cash I get weekly for the last 4 months and put it into LRC. Literally was .38 cents when I started, it is now @2.19$ and my avg buy price has increased to .87cents. My point is that if you invested 300$ a month at an average of .87 cents you would’ve had roughly $1200 worth of LRC or about 1379LRC at the rate of $2.19 each right now you would’ve had $3020 or roughly 2.5x the amount of money, then turned around and invested that if you so wish to buy more GME. You just have to trust the process, the GME play has been a LONG play since the beginning, meaning BUY HODL DRS, if you want overnight money and volatility beyond your wildest dreams go with what’s guaranteed to increase 30% almost weekly now and will explode as soon as this NFT thing is announced. Just my thoughts and I do understand where you come from but also understand the type of play we all signed up for. These HFs have had deep pockets from the start, lawyers, politicians, SEC DTCC etc board members and leaders all in the same deep deep pockets. They have kicked the can and will continue. We can only prepare for the inevitable MOASS but no guarantee what day it will happen or how high it will go. This is the way.
My avg is much higher than yours, you would’ve been around the .60 cent avg with the amount of money monthly you invested so it would’ve meant much more LRC",1636441000,hjwqoz0
"I’ve hopped on the LRC train today. I got all the confirmation after the tweet from the man himself. Pulling off everything from Webull and buying more GME/LRC. I got butterflies and I feel great, who is with me 🚀🚀🚀💎🙌🦍",1636440536,hjwq2cc
"Cursing came from comment above yours that not only threw out bait to start an argument but added a second comment that was basically “come at bro”. I’m not going to let misinformation go unchecked, I’m sorry.

I said their futures are connected. I believe that to be true. I absolutely believe their recent rises are connected, BTS. 

LRC going from .02- 2.50 has has given me more money to load up on GME and the original investment will grow again left in LRC as we have an active connection confirmed with evidence. It’s not GME’s MOASS rise but If you’re going to act like going .02 to $2.59+ since May is not going to the moon on that growth I’m not sure of any argument you might consider.",1636439702,hjwowr1
Comment was removed for suggesting another sub. Basically it’s too much to get into here and I respect that. There’s some good reading out there but you can get into LRC easy if you find that it’s a good investment or trade play,1636439674,hjwovco
I remember what it was. The free $1.50 LRC went up to $2.50 last week. Then it dropped. Lowest that I saw when logged into Coinbase after that was $1.13 last weekend.,1636439292,hjwobl6
"Education thing? I don’t really understand the coin. I thought i read that they were making a mew blockchain tech that would allow transfers without the massive gas costs of ether, but when I bought some LRC, it still cost 35 dollars to move it.",1636439168,hjwo516
"You infer too much. All I said is their futures are aligned. Loopring will be developmental in running and facilitating GME’s future meta verse endeavors. They enable low cost transaction fees and a customer facing UI that will get normal consumers to adopt hard to understand technology. Our head of Blockchain literally co-created the technology Loopring uses. 

So please don’t get on the daily talking out of your behind and cursing because you can’t see the forest through the trees. If someone who owns a plethora of GME shares wants to diversify into Coins as well, LRC is the safest bet. Even being supported by DD and leaked screenshots of code where they are working within GameStop.com.",1636438917,hjwns0a

So please stfu about not caring and wanting your money, LRC has been in this for months and you could’ve already made a significant amount. You should be happy to have learned so much investing knowledge at your age and FOR FREE. You sound like a another entitled college prick with a couple shares expecting to make 200 million, please youngin sit down &amp; be humble.",1636438768,hjwnk1u
I am so glad to own LRC.,1636438763,hjwnjs4
I am so stoked you agree. Seen a large amount of superstonkers pumping money into LRC. Yet the float is not locked!,1636438712,hjwnh12

"^

No reason to buy RH's stock because they allow you to trade GME.

I'm treating LRC the same. Not that they are bad like RH but the concept is the same.

It's not going to moon because GME moons, that's a dangerous line of thinking with no substantial evidence whatsoever.",1636438642,hjwndgb
LRC is going to the moon. GME is going to fucking Uranus,1636438566,hjwn9fu
"Im gonna challenge that.

LRC won't moon just because GameStop will. 

That's like saying the NYSE will moon for the same reason that GME does. 

There isn't a fundamental reason for it to stay coupled to the company.",1636438439,hjwn311
Are you going to the moon or funding the moon mission 🧐 LRC is a distraction,1636438320,hjwmwpu

LRC giving me popcorn vibes NGL.,1636437869,hjwm882
"Glad we can see something in common.

To be clear: BUY GME and DSR that shit.

I have over 7XX DSR'd and wouldn't sell a one to buy LRC.

BUT I converted ALL of my crypto assets that I didn't sell to buy GME into LRC a little over a week ago when the GitHub code leaked at 2AM. Made about 400% gains on it. Dope. I'd sell it and buy more GME but short term capitol gains on that would suck ass so imma ride those out there.",1636437191,hjwl6x6
LRC,1636436690,hjwkfbo
"Fair enough, I was a bit tilted at all the LRC posts lately, feels a bit off topic when it stops being about their tech, progress, announcements, or their price movement, in relation to GS. (Some some post earlier of people literally talking here about selling at some range, re-buying later, slippery slope to doubleU SB.  


But yeah, hodl is probably a reference to crypto in some way regardless, we know we are going into that area, I guess we'll see what happens eventually.",1636436495,hjwk4g9
"I didn't say he was saying to buy lrc. You're making a straw man to attack instead of addressing using those two separate and distinct word side by side in the context of everything that's come to light in the last few weeks about nfts, it's reasonable to hypothesize that he's talking about crypto as well.

My theory is that I think he's about to move GameStop's stock entirely on an NFT blockchain where you won't be holding stock anymore you'll be HODLing stocks.

I'm not going to argue the semantics of those two separate words though. I entered into the crypto community around 2013. I know where the word came from and what it means because I was there.",1636436332,hjwjv4f
"People say hodl regardless in non-crypto world regarding shares, options, etc. It's really no different.

Could he be referencing crypto because of the words origin? maybe, I doubt his tweets have single meanings. Is he saying BUY LRC? no.",1636435974,hjwj9yq
"I used the last 2k in my checking account to buy LRC early last week.  Enjoying the living hell out of watching it grow.

If (when) they announce it’s going to be balls to the wall FOMO on both.  I’m super jacked.",1636435218,hjwi0yh
"He's literally just doing a tweet like Musk did regarding what he might have to pay, where he gave the option to Twitter, to sell or not, but there are no other options than hold for RC... there's some straight up non-sense to justify talking about LRC in the context of actually trading it recently.",1636434832,hjwhdgn

"Yeah, I plan to take my LRC gains here soon and bring it over to Computershare for more GME. Rinse and repeat as the token 20x itself over the next couple of months.",1636382353,hjt35kt

"Wrong sub, but yeah. Happy to see a rumoured GME partner do well.

Let's hope both moon soon.

If not you can always turn your LRC gains into more GME.",1636381533,hjt1e2k

why all eth and no lrc?,1636381249,hjt0s9i
"I’m looking to take my profits from peripheral investments, so I can just leave my GME alone, swimming in the infinity pool. 

Other stocks in the basket, those are absolutely getting sold for paying off debt, buying a house, etc. And my LRC, that’s probably forever investment as well. 

Everything I can do to make it so I don’t even have to be tempted to sell a single share of GME. I’m dead tired of the little guy getting fucked by capitalism and greed. Time to turn this shit around. 

No cell, no sell. Fuck these criminals.",1636380499,hjsz827
This right here is how I’ve lead things into GME with the crypto creeps. I’ve been mentioning LRC at work for a couple weeks now and guys are starting to come up to me and ask “how did you know about LRC?” And I give a little side smirk and say “GameStop” 🦍💜🟣,1636380452,hjsz4i5

My issue is that with any new tech, the barrier is uptake and understanding, more so when money or identity are involved. I think the only way this will be taken up en masse is if we can come up with a process / bundle / app that takes the stress out of knowing what all of it is and gets rid of all the tech speak and long tech terminology...

"Came here to say this since OP does not seem to quite grasp the entire point behind tether being a thing… 

tether is pegged to the dollar, for those that don’t know what that means: “A dollar peg is when a country maintains its currency's value at a fixed exchange rate to the U.S. dollar.” For this instance just replace country’s currency with USDT. That means the exchange rate for tether is fixed and is suppose to stay at $1 = 1USDT. This “stablecoin” being pegged at $1 means that it is used across many exchanges when you exchange USD and put it into your exchange account (Coinbase, kraken, bitfinex, etc) then you go and buy yourself some BTC or LRC, your $1 is exchanged for 1 USDT which then the value in the USDT is used to exchange for whatever you’re buying. Using USDT instead of USD on exchanges increases the speed and liquidity of crypto exchange transactions. Now in order for USDT to maintain its value, it has to be backed by assets that can then be divided by the number of coins and equal $1. This is how it is supposed to be pegged. Without the backing of the assets, then the USDT’s value is determined by the market and it is no longer pegged and it is no longer a stablecoin, which defeats the ENTIRE purpose of its existence. The problem with them injecting $1.5B-worth of USDT into the system is the fact that that has to be backed by assets in order for it to remain pegged to $1. Tether has been shady all along with their assets used to peg their coin, and the theory is the injection is likely not backed by any actual currency and was just injected, reducing the value of the USDT and threatening for the currency to break the buck, meaning the assets to coins falls below $1 per coin. 

If you care to look deeper into Tether and the assets it is using to peg its coin to the USD, you’ll find it is actually backed very little by actual cash and largely backed by commercial paper and corporate bonds. This is fine as long as the bonds are stable and the returns/coupons/interest on them are coming in. The big problem is that a large portion of Tether’s assets backing USDT is held in Chinese commercial pape, you know, all those real estate development companies that are falling like dominoes. When those companies go bankrupt, the bonds/commercial paper tether has backing their currency disappear *poof* and take a large portion of tether’s assets out of their proverbial vault causing USDT to break the buck. If they lose too much (they currently hold about $31B in commercial paper/CDs, unknown how much is Chinese, out of $62B in reserves/assets) of that value, the buck is broken big time and tether will have to either come up with assets to back up their currency (unlikely), or it goes to $0 a coin as the market loses faith in its peg and insiders and exchanges which hold the vast majority of USDT dump the coin and exchange it for either other coins or USD. Tether is what provides the liquidity in the majority of crypto exchanges, and that liquidity goes *poof* if tether disappears, and we all know what happens as liquidity gets dryer than the Sahara. 

So basically OPs whole argument of “it only makes tether worth less” is the EXACT problem with the injection. Tethers WHOLE point is to be pegged to $1, and if it’s value goes down, it is no longer pegged.",1638783294,hnfwa6r
Only GME for me. Not even lrc has the potential gains of GME. After MOASS I might invest in them,1638782745,hnfvncc
"Might be trying to take advantage of the situation to pump his own stablecoin into usage. Be aware though that most are backed with big bucks companies with one notable exception.

USDC - Coinbase
USDT - tether, that shady Chinese firm. This might be the key to all crypto crashing -&gt; hedgies infinite money glitch
USC - US coin iirc

The exception is DAI, which is decentralized stablecoin with good faith in it, the reserves are fully auditable I believe. It's on ETH Blockchain (same as LRC) however has many different asset classes on it as backing. Not to deviate too far off topic but DAI can also change it's peg away from USD in case it needs to as many use it as collateral. 

Anyways, I will take the non company backed stablecoin and watchout for tether in the news probably soon",1638780593,hnft4xv

"I think this current dip has more to do with trying to depress the stock before the LRC announcement, which will likely bump the price just in general. Apes are not the only people holding GME and an announcement like that could see some FOMO buying across currently untapped market sectors. 

My theory is that with Evergrande likely to be worthless as collateral from some time this week, and the LRC announcement likely to bump the price, they need to get into a very low safe zone before that bump so it doesn't fuck them when EG can't be keep Marge at bay.

If they can't get it down below whatever their magic number is before EG finally hits the ground, we could be in for a very MOASS Christmas. Otherwise I think it will drag on a good while longer before we get into that final pre-rip dip.

• Tomorrow is a Tuesday. There’s always been tinfoil around something happening on a Tuesday because Ryan tweeted of a GME store next to a store that was called ‘Tuesday’
• Tomorrow is national ape day

Of course, GME is the only play. But some of their counter-arguments sounds similar to the GME apes here

I think my favorite recent thing that happened was a few months ago I mentioned thanking Dr. T for introducing us to DRS in which I was mass down-voted and people called her a shill. Now everyone is talking about DRS and praising her.

Kinda like how everyone for some reason loved Gherkinit or whatever and now everyone hates him. Like did nobody hear learn about the last few YouTubers? The ones that all turned into actual shills or were against holding and didn't believe in MOASS?

Don't even get me started on the LRC sub and how apes ruined it. Someone made a post yesterday about ""Incoming shills"". Why the fuck would they need to create negative sentiment against LRC? A crypto. Like.. get that paranoid shit outta here lol.

I think the most cringey thing is people regurgitating anything RC posts on Twitter thinking they feel so cool like ""Buckle Up"" and ""It takes money to buy whiskey"" like you're grown men/women lol

What happens when Elon decides to dump all of his Tesla shares and buy GME with the proceeds?  What happens when unicorns show up and start shitting solid gold cornflakes?

Nearly anything *could* happen, and almost none of it will.  Will LRC hit $50?  Sure, eventually.  Maybe in a few years.  But to hit that figure at the start of 2022 would require a massive uptick in demand for the token, which means a massive surge in utilization of Loopring's L2 services.  Yeah, they're launching a marketplace some time in Q4, and it may even be partnered with Gamestop, but it's not going to be an overnight success.  It will take time.",1637101661,hkwu5cl
Maybe? One LRC per dividend...which doesn't sound like much but it would give access to the new NFT exchange...maube it will coded in a special way or something?,1637101614,hkwu16q
"Just because you own LRC doesn't mean you can claim ownership of the blockchain NFT.

I.e. just because you own ethereum doesn't mean you have access to a one of a kind rare NFT, a rare cryptopunk?

The NFT itself can provide digital ownership of a product such as an actual share. The NFT could be passed out to share holders to prove their actual ownership of a share. 

Luxury brands have slowly been playing around with issuing NFTs with their goods to combat counterfeits. 

We may be at the cusp of really innovative and transformative times in not just the finance sector, but proof of ownership across a wide gamut of industries",1637101573,hkwtxh6

"That is 3.72% of a single penny, and that was to move $160m in LRC. I think its fair to say gas fees are free.

"Yeah I think it’ll almost have to work this way. Exchanging usd for lrc in order to buy nfts (I think) is a recipe for retail skepticism and people generally being reluctant to participate.

Of course I have no idea what I’m talking about really, so this is more of an impression than a fully formed insight.",1637101450,hkwtmh5

"Nope.  It's too easy to put a value on LRC, and a low one at that.  It's under $3/token at the moment, and the SHFs could easily afford to throw an extra $3/share at shareholders (like they did with the Overstock case with their special agreements).  The LRC is just a token, not an NFT.  Even at $10 each (which would be great for me because I already hold a couple thousand I bought at under $1), they could still pay that amount.  I mean, let's assume that there's a billion synthetics, that's still only $3 billion, maybe as much as $10 billion.  That's a lot of money, but nothing significant when you consider all of the players and certainly not going to ignite MOASS.

Most likely they are just getting the last pieces in position for launching their marketplace, and the 61 million figure is just a coincidence.",1637100220,hkwql5i

Like that's not the point, but HUGE benefit because I wasted so much of that and the other coin getting things onto layer 2, but once it is---

once something is on layer 2, it only costs a TINY amount of lrc to move between accounts, send or receive..  

The only part that makes me suspect this even could have anything to do with GME is the amount being a couple hundred million dollar transaction (of any amount--it's big) is that whatever GME does if it's a collab with L2 of loopring (and low gas fees) still has gas fees required to move anything on the marketplace.

I was simply pointing out if that were the case, LRC wouldn't be $2.60 for long. So I'm still a little confused how you managed to translate this into me saying buying LRC is the way to squeeze GME shorts ... it would be the short-sellers who would need to buy the LRC, and if they had to do so for the millions and millions of naked shares of GME that are out there, LRC would likely squeeze (and GME probably would too since LRC is in such short supply).",1637098686,hkwmrcn

The Loopring cryptocurrency, LRC, is necessary for key operations on the protocol. 

&gt; For instance, anyone who wishes to operate a decentralized exchange on Loopring must lock up at least 250,000 LRC, which enables the operator to run an exchange that uses its on-chain data proofs. An operator must stake 1 million LRC to run an exchange without this feature

""So what’s next. I am not leaving Loopring because I am tired of it, or because I am not interested in its future. I think you may see from my sappy message above, that is not the case. The fact is, an opportunity has presented itself that I am extremely excited about, and I feel I simply must take. I view it as a once-in-a-lifetime, perfect-timing, far-reaching opportunity/challenge that I need to pursue for its own sake, and for my personal development. I cannot give more information at the moment, but I will be sure to do so when the time is right — I hope on the order of a few months.

I started my acct with only $10, and now have $40 in LRC just from fucking around doing quizzes about crypto. Seems like a good investment and it was pretty easy to do, andf I learned a little about various types of crypto along the way.

Sometime the quizzes glitch and don't work. But hey, when it does, free money is free money. And that $40 LRC might be worth a whole lot more in a year or two after GME's NFT marketplace has launched and been thoroughly established.

no cryptic tweets from RC/GME. no cryptic likes from the NFT/LRC folk. Just silence and business as usual from everyone and then moon.

the more people hint/joke/refer to MOASS the more it feels like its just done for engagement/building an online presence and would be done regardless of whether MOASS was a possibiltiy and its just a nod to what everyone is talking about",1638892131,hnls8rg
"Mate I'm with you on this.
People have YOLO'd all they have into GME. Credit cards have been taken and maxed out. Mortgages taken out on homes. Cars sold. Medical bills not paid. If this doesn't come off people need to be aware that they may be waiting along time to break even or see a return on investments.

I've put all I have into it. I believe in it. I can see it happening one day when, I don't know.

But at the moment I'm working and bills are being paid and life is good. I'm not dependant on the money I've invested nor am I missing or need it.

I'm just. Zen.

But I'm also prepared for it not to happen as a worse case scenario. I'm not doing this for RC or LRC. I'm doing this because it's an investment opportunity that may change my life forever if it comes to fruition.

If it doesn't, RC or GameStop or Loopring aren't going to say, sorry about that pal, here's your money back.

RC is not a God. He is not our leader. He is just a man with a company that I've invested in and based on his previous company I can see a good return. But things happen. Things change. Things go from good to bad in seconds. I'm prepared for that.",1638891472,hnlqr8d

"You didn't, but the poster I was originally responding to did. Sorry if I came off as snarky; that wasn't my intention.

You're not wrong, on any account - and LRC has definitely been seeing price manipulation since ape interest started to show up there. I don't think SHF interest in LRC (if it *is* them and not simply greedy whales leashing the price) was planned, though. I think it had more to do with preventing apes with a mind to flip LRC post-moon and roll their profits back into GME from doing so.

"I have never used that word to describe it. Instead, I see a similarity between LRC and January distraction meme stocks and hedgie pump&amp;dumps just like when this shit started _but_ by presumably completely different groups with a seemingly different motive, whatever it is. Anybody would now know that apes represent a... _not inconsiderable_ buying power that could perhaps be leveraged as a group onto which one could, say, offload someone's bags, or what have you. Hedgies only wanted to divide our buying power and conquer, so as to tame the power behind the squeeze into just a sneeze. I don't know how big a role distraction stocks played in that, but popcorn has definitely taken from us many an ape and their liquid capital that could have squeezed Kenny a lot harder all throughout 2021.

It's also worth noting that what's happening right now isn't a ""price explosion"", but a rebalance back to where it was before the hysteria dip from the corona ""news"". This is the range LRC has been trading in for most of the last five weeks.",1638889342,hnlls2c

The 36% today was because it tanked over the weekend and recovered a bit. I think the price rocketed a bit in late October based on a mix of FOMO and likely some institutional buy in.

"19,000 in USDC and DAI ( -&gt; \~15,000 USDT short). 

In the beginning this was in ETH, but I sold it all to stables when ETH was at \~3200$ (I know, ngmi, lol). Although I lost the upside run to 4k+, I feel much safer now, because I'm somewhat safe against ETH or general market depreciation. (Still long on ETH in form of specific NFTs, and long on LRC/ENS)

Will it work like I expect it? Who knows. It's in the realm of possibilities that USDC or even DAI might fall heavily, but that's fine. I have a script with a flash loan ready to swap my USDC+DAI to ETH if we fall beneath 1,800$.

Sofar, I made \~1.5k interest on collateral, and \~2 AAVE from protocol incentives. Around 800$ (short) interest on USDT.

Also, I'm toying with the idea of going short on USDT against LRC. I don't expect it to fall beyond 1$, so I'll probably short \~0.7 USDT for every LRC I own, and use it to leverage my LRC position even higher, until I fully maxed out the surplus leveraged LRC (to effectively go short \~1 USDT for every LRC in my leveraged position).",1638888214,hnlj8k7

knowledge and education can make all it easier to hold, and anticipate the next big shrek dick candles. 

For example... we're due to have a ~16M volume trading day sometime between now and earnings. Not some voodoo tweet, not based on LRC, reddit, but pure cold facts and expiration of certain derivatives that demands sacrifice in volume. GME almost always shoots up with increase in volume so...I'm personally looking forward to Mon/Tues this week, but it could be later. Anyways, titties are always jacked.",1638095649,hmdxxui
My gfs coworker laughed at me for investing into GME. She told me he said he must be on 'super stonk'. Mother fucker doesn't know I'm up 150% on GME and 250% on LRC in 11 months. Bitch probably doesn't even know jack shit when it comes to the markets. (I live in Aus),1638090606,hmdrmvt
"Damn. I was giving you the benefit of doubt throughout this conversation because I thought you are an LRC investor who's interested in learning about GME. But you're completely uninterested in engaging with our DD and at some point I have to ask myself: what is this guy then even doing on Superstonk?

I mean, having different opinions is fine and all. But it looks like you just came to our sub to spread FUD about GME.",1638089537,hmdq9rw

LRC seems to work on their own wallets and stuff...

**Imagine crypto would be accessible to all and not rely on shady exchanges any longer, no insane gas fees and so on...** this is soooooooo massive OMGOAAAT!

Not kidding, just look at Coinbase market cap... will be ""assimilated"" by taking away their business and additionally NFT, DRM and more... **we talk about increasing share price target by factor 10x at least even without a squeeze.**

No financial advice, but I am really so excited 🤣🚀✨🌒",1637837739,hm0t071
"The current crypto system is f..ed up. LRC and GME will change all that. But likely there has to be a crash first, like in real finance.

A new age will start with GME/LRC... IMHO best play is likely invest all into GME and after the MOASS and also crash in crypto, investing some into LRC or other value projects, not BS like dog themed coins without inner value. Guess the GME market place will make it easy accessible and safe.

**Look at Coinbase market cap to give you a hint about how much growth we talk here!** And that is just one of the many startups GME is working on right now...

"I like to think that Gamestop will be unveiling a massive nft exchange that will operate through Looprings Layer 2 and utilize LRC tokens as the main currency.

In regard to a nft dividend? I don’t think they will issue a nft per say, but instead create a special whitelist for shareholders (effectively the same thing). After researching and partaking a bit in the nft marketplace the past few days, I think it could be particularly cool if they provided a special white list for people who own shares so they get first come first serve and exclusive access to nfts. This will not only boost the rarity of the nfts, but allow shareholders to get in first. It will also boost the shit out of loopring if its the main token that whitelisted peeps can purchase the nft with.

RC has known Matt Finestone for years

MJB  messed up DFV cost basis / Roaring Kitty tweets way back

Rc must have turned to Finestone around 2018 and said let's change this around,  if I can get a seat on GameStop can we create a new exchange Matt Finestone says yes


They then discovered loopring Coin LRC and work together  in complete silence 


Check this out

[The Man With The Plan  Ryan  Cohen ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ofiev4/the_man_with_the_plan/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)


The DD doesn't mention  Matt Finestone or LRC


Why???? Because of silence,  no one in their right mind buys 9 million stonk at random then decides  say hey I'm going to build an exchange...without a surefire execution method !!!!!! 


Ryan Cohen is a master at playing chess.......but because of silence we can't put a seal of confirmation on it. 


Think about it...a new exchange under 1 year ......that doesn't happen without some massive planning....

I think DFV was watching what RC next move was going to be, then when he noticed RC interest in GameStop, the short interest,  the fuckery...DFV bought and by some mysterious way RC blended right in


It's tin foil....buy there is just no freaking way this is being pulled off in less than one year.




Also,  DFV was 100% certain to the point of doing in depth video about RC becoming chairman with conviction.....how ?


There is a missing black hole possibly connecting  DFV and RC together

 I like the crypto. If the fundamentals are what they claim to be, then LRC is a game-changer. I personally believe that there is a partnership in the works. But it's impossible to be certain at this point. That's why I hold a little LRC.

How is it silenced? It is actually all over the biggest crypto subs and they are all super bullish on it. Which is actually quite interesting. Usually they seem to be a bit anti GME (on the stock) but more or less everybody loves the fundamentals of LRC and is happy that it gets the well deserved attention true GME,1636628834,hk6tyxt
"I converted all of my crypto into LRC and i'm enjoying the camaraderie with Looptards.  Am i gonna sell my GME and buy LRC? Not on your fucking nellie.

I have a serious amount invested in GME and there is just no way I would invest that in all the hype surrounding LRC with fairly limited DD. The DD for GME has been outstanding and is deep as a very deep motherfucking ocean.

In summary GME is my wife and LRC is my new exciting fuck buddy that gives me regular boners for now.

My personal opinion is that MOASS is at the start of January.

It would make sense for Gamestop to become a long term HODL'er of LRC tokens as I'm sure Loopring would offer some sort of discount fee structure for HODL'ers. 

Not saying that is or is not the case here, but most crypto based projects incentivise HODL'ing of their tokens in a variety of ways. It wouldn't be a requierments however but I'm sure there would be incentives to encourage it.",1636622689,hk6mpu2

"No, you're misconstruing my words again - reading comprehension doesn't seem to be your strong suit. Let's try this again. 

I said that not everybody has the ability to just yolo everything into GME and wait for MOASS - some people have life obligations to keep up with (family, children, rent, mortgage, car payments etc). So for these apes who already have their GME stack, they can also get in on a GME-related play with LRC that will not only benefit GME but also potentially 10-20X thereby providing financial relief until MOASS gets here.",1636622189,hk6m5mc

It's as you say, If LRC moons, people will 1: Jump on it, 2: Ask WHY its mooning, 3: Research more about Loopring.  


This all goes full circle, as once people realize its due to GME, they will likely check out GME and/or buy it, which then again fuels the fire.   


Also, imagine LRC going to 10USD, apes cash out, then buy a shitton of GME with profits.

"That's a pretty bad faith argument, in fact I'll argue it's a *false equivalence fallacy.* The **major** difference is that it's the only one of the comparisons you made where it's an investment. RRP, Evergrande default coverage, inflation, bank light speculation, bank loan issues, political corruption, celebrity tweets... These aren't investments, they're all information that can *affect* an investment though. LRC/crypto/Loopring stock... Those are investments, not only that but they don't affect Gamestop, I would argue the speculation affects them instead. So no, it's not the same. They're price and movements don't affect our investment in Gamestop and thus have no place here. If you believe in the speculation keep it to news about their L2 and marketplace platform, not their price movement. That's shilling, the fact people even feel the need to defend it by saying they're hodling LRC or whatever just gives vibes of division attempts to persuade people to hodl popcorn, and other meme stocks back in the early days.   


TLDR: You're making a False Equivalence Fallacy and your entire post is in bad faith. Price action of and relating to Loopring has no bearing here. No one cares what you hodl besides GME, mentions of others mirrors shill pushing/division of other meme stocks in Jan/Feb.",1636621115,hk6kyrz

Just look at how it moves in correlation with BTC (why BTC? Doesn't it use ETH?). You can see the movement tracked on coinmarketcap site (at least it's where I saw it). Just weird!

Regardless, Apes will not be deterred.

"Over-speculative in my view. Loopring has the right tech, but that seems too far outside of Gamestop's business model... going to develop a decentralized stock exchange even if it is with Loopring. Now, developing an NFT marketplace to give true digital ownership for gamers is right up Gamestop's alley... that makes a lot of sense to me. \*IF\* Loopring is developing a decentralized blockchain-based stock exchange they would probably be partnering with another company/org that is already more focused on this sector (Fidelity? Coinbase? fluff if I know).

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I am super excited about the possibility of Loopring (or something else) hosting a DEX for securities. I even personally believe that this \*should\* eventually happen for the integrity and security of our markets. However, I don't belive GameStops's partnership with Loopring is the project that will bring that about.

UNLESS... Gmerica is the big surprise they've been waiting to unveil, a separate branch that is dedicated to leading companies (and their publically traded securities) out of a rigged market system bringing us into a new era of DeFi. Nothing short of revolutionary in my view.

It also brings a brand new profit stream because the original creator of an NFT can automatically get percentages of the proceeds whenever they are sold.

As a blockchain developer specifically ethereum dapps.. thank you. You hit home on this and this is the general consensus in the eth community. Although in the coming 6 months ethereums usage will sky rocket.. a blockchain worth about $500 billion that sees $1-2 trillion plus transacted on the network daily? I can’t see ethereum moving below $1800 I just know too many institutions who would pounce on it at $2500-$3000 my own LLC included. I don’t have this sentiment with any other crypto besides LRC which will obviously fail if ethereum does.,1639668957,hosh89u

"Once you are on the Loopring app you will have access to all dapps (which will likely include the GameStop NFT marketplace. You’ll be able to provide liquidity or stake in other various pools to earn a percentage of the platforms fees. And of course you’ll have access to the L2 exchange with no fee* instant transactions. (The exchange is the only portion available without the Loopring wallet via another wallet like MetaMask. 

Once there, you can exchange any currency they support for pretty much free or transact with I’m the layer, again for almost free. The negligible fees are paid in fractions of LRC. 

The on ramp simply lets you inject fiat directly to the L2, bypassing the need to go fiat to L1 (ETH gas) and then L1 to L2 (more ETH gas). They are not a CEX, they will be simply partnering with someone to give direct access to L2 (presumably for a small fee compared to any ETH gas transaction). 

Loopring’s Discord is probably one of the best one stop shops for learning about it all. They have a beginners guide and a FAQ section for each aspect of the project that is very helpful. 

As far as the use case goes, it seems like you are only thinking about it as a DEX. While as a DEX alone it blows any L1 DEXs out of the water because of the fees alone, the DEX is one small portion of the available features.  Where the DEXs you listed are essentially two trick ponies (liquidity and exchange).",1639664401,hos6koe

"Personally, I am only buying shares directly with Computershare, and buying/transferring shares with IBKR.  I want to ensure that no matter what happens with any brokers, I still have a considerable amount of shares in Computershare.  It's the only way, retailers can crush the SHFs.

I mean the proof is Gamestop reported DRS, we have had clues that DRS is the way.  The only way RC can push the button, is that he is 100% certain that gamestop can crush the SHFs and that's by DRS.

I am sure Gamestop and RC wanted the shorters to pay up, so they can continue their business, but SHFs are absolutely fucked and have to continue to short.  RC now sees the only way to get Gamestop going and protect the investors is DRS.  Nothing else.  

Forget about NFTs, LRC, quarterly reports.  Everything they have planned for the company to succeed, will absolutely not stop the SHFs from shorting Gamestop.

I believe Ryan Cohen is waiting till at least &gt;100% of the float is DRS'd.  He can then be certain to pull the trigger.  I don't even think Gamestop and Loopring will announce a deal, because retailers are DRSing, and retailers can get the job done.

If people want to 100% direct their shares with Computershare.  That's absolutely great, because the moment people start to sell during MOASS, there is a lot more XXXX owners who will DRS their remaining shares.  I believe apes are not greedy, and they will continue to DRS, which will allow all the smaller apes to be rich as well.",1639659531,horwwpf

"Like i said - mods dont know everything. They are just volunteers from the ranks of fellow apes. 

I didnt mean it in the way that everyone could just edit code, but upload their own, make it look like an accidental data leak or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say you are a shortie who is getting bored from just kicking the can. And even the latest FUD-campaigns promoting paperhanding on brokers who dont allow transfers/DRS isnt working as good as you´d hoped.

You want a big more oomph. A kick in the nuts of apes. Spread the sense of betrayal. Then you see posts about a ridiculous Hiphop-album which apes somehow want to connect to the stock for nor reason (talking about actual factual proof and not tha fact that someone might own the same hoodie as RC - guess what most companies dont just sell uniques...) so you know they are willing to grab onto ANYTHING they can just imagine might have even the slightest coincidental connection.

So you get to work:

Step 1 Maybe make some account called RCGMELOOPRINGLOVECHILD or whatever - it doesnt really matter and Step 2 just post some Code snippets that *might* hint at connections, a NFT marketplace, a NFT-dividend distribution system, the cure for cancer and aids and whatnot, Step 3 then drop a link to your code in the GME subs. Step 4 Apes gobble it up -&gt;Diversion-&gt; they buy  literally anything else but GME-&gt; less buying pressure directly on GME-&gt; more can kicking + additional shorting as long as the float isnt completely locked up Step 5 massive Demoralization once the secret partner is revealed to be freaking RobingtheHood (M.Night.Shyamalan wrote that twist) or literally anyone else except Gamestop. LRC gets dumped, apes loose money. Paperhanding. Trust issues. Yet again another forum migration. Step 6 the trust got some cracks. Now the share price was dumped back down to 100 or even 40$ so you can actually start to (slowly) close more and more shorts. Step 7 Profit.

&amp;#x200B;

Trust and faith is cool and all, but unconditional trust and blind faith will lead to bad times. 

The DD was already done.

"LRC is tied to ETH since it rolls into that coin's network. 

ETH price correlates to BTC, but they have been diverging. 

A crash in BTC will depress ETH to some extent and by extension LRC.

ETH can operate independently of BTC so it'll only sell off what big money is trying to store in its network. 

This means that if BTC sells off 50% and ETH correlates 50%, LRC may only drop by 25% if it correlates to ETH 50%. 

This would make LRC a 1:4 correlation to BTC.

With how LRC has exploded in relative value recently, it could also not correlate at all.

 Correlations aren't guarantees, they are just observations of a pattern of occurrences in price.",1639629975,hoqqnat

"Great questions. Will try to answer:

1. LRC has found a passionate group of diamond hands that are now buying up the coin to stabilize. As demand begins to outstrip price, eventually it will go up. 

2. Gme is already detached from the market in that it poses an Idiosyncratic risk to the system from being over shorted. LRC is also detached in that it is a true defi exchange and is not owned by hedgies so therefore it will begin to take money from hedgies when news of it's announcement breaks out. 

There is speculation Coinbase is doing something like Robinhood's pfof and internalizung orders but not buying the coin in open market. Therefore, when users migrate mass Exodus to Loopring's L2 Wallet, it will squeeze Coinbase by forcing them to buy LRC at open market price. This has been happening lately as cb users have begun migrating out only to discover Coinbase is having a hard time with transfering coins out. Which makes one wonder, were the coin alsos ever bought in first place? Users tracked cbase wallet cuz Blockchain tech reveals the transactions, so this is the closest proof that cbase engaged in shady stuff.

Well the whole LRC hype on here got me to buy in few days ago at $3.00... I only invested 100 bucks but I still should have just threw that 100 at GME but it was the weekend and I wanted to buy something,1637109448,hkxc81y
"Close only counts in horseshoes and hand-grenades 

Honestly the fact that the LRC amount is CLOSE and the fact that 741 happens to be 3 numbers in a different number doesn’t really inspire a lot of confidence in this theory, along with the fact that LRC isn’t “non-fungible”. I’m not saying your wrong but….definitely a stretch here",1637109386,hkxc2wi
"I disagree. The hedgies will be unable to issue an NFT, it has nothing to do with dollar value a coin. They cannot just buy LRC and say, here mr fake shareholder, here is your NFT. This is very similar to what happened to overstock. The hedgies are fucked, completely fucked. There is no way out for them.",1637109223,hkxbpgh
I think the point is that  there’s not enough lrc in circulation to cover all the shorts positions. Making even a measly 2.64 something they can’t cover without either closing positions or running the price of LRC up to ridiculous levels.,1637109167,hkxbkwr

If they’re going to be individualized, why not start there? Turning a token into an NFT is not a thing if that’s what you’re suggesting, and tracking that token amongst a sea of them already in my wallet isn’t possible. FIFO only applies to paying taxes on gains.",1637108992,hkxb6la

"shf could just buy 1 lrc per short share and pay the dividend to people who are owed one. Lrc are fungibles.

I tried reading that “how to use loopring L2” guide but it’s just like a completely foreign language to me, I have no idea what any of it means. I’m trying to familiarize myself with Bitcoin and block chain and crypto farming but it seems like every explanation for it requires an extensive underlying secret knowledge or something. Which is my main issue with it. Like how is this supposed to replace our current system or at least become a little more mainstream if most people can’t understand how it works.

Although, your explanation makes your concern clearer so I appreciate that.",1637107751,hkx8cis

Not an NFT dividend means naked shorts could just buy however many LRC they need or offer cash.",1637107486,hkx7qtl

I don't think they'll give every share 1 LRC. It doesn't make sense as all it does is squeeze LRC as the shorts can get them easily at market. Using them for market liquidity in the NFT marketplace makes more sense and then giving shareholders a share of something invaluable is the play imho.,1637107290,hkx7awx
As to the amount I'm still trying to figure that one out myself.  The reason I expect is that the lrc token is also so that we have something on the market when it gets released also. The creation the wallet and then depositing of the coin is also so that they have a place to put the NFT also. This would just streamline the process. They could do a batch order with this way.

Loopring has announced their market is NFT compatible in August. They have also announced users can mint NFTs on L2 for an extraordinarily low fee using LRC or Eth (compared to L1).

There are liquidity pools awarding 100%+ APR on L2 *now*. That's like getting a 3% return every 2 weeks. So in *relatively normal conditions* this transaction could set him up to make $4m every 2 weeks. What happens when a globally significant launch happens &amp; everyone clammers onto L2?

In this scenario creating a coin would have little to no initial intrinsic value (much like if you decided to make your own fiat currency - all currency is based on what people believe it’s worth). So instead, GME bought this LRC as reserves so that at launch their own coin is pegged in value to LRC 1:1. It would work much like how China uses Foreign currency reserves to maintain their fixed exchange rate, or how USDT/USDC operates.

LRC might be fungible, but GME-coin wouldn’t be (because the float is controlled by GME). So you have a non fungible coin that has an initial value of ~$2.50 (in line with healthy dividend value) that is also a crypto, thus destroying the shorts.",1637105330,hkx2sir

All of my $ is tied up in GME shares, I’ve never made a post about Loopring before. I’m just still capable of seeing both the forest and the trees. Are you? 

It isn’t speculation by the way. The code is already in place, the partnership is official already, even if it hasn’t been officially revealed to the public yet.

Loopring is the technology that is going to allow GME to become the dominant player in the NFT marketplace space. 

You don’t have to understand or like these posts. But they are absolutely about GameStop and bullish AF 🚀🚀🚀",1636553052,hk2hdm7

Its all a fucking speculation. Want to yolo on LRC? Sure be my guest, but dont spam this shit here.

I always sprinkle a little on crypto here and there.",1636552624,hk2ggrk
"I never said you made any predictions. You did, however, bring up popcorn when it's completely irrelevant and didn't make any attempts to relate it to GME. 

I'm also not bothered at all when LRC is mentioned. Or RRP or Tesla or any of that talk. That's all pretty relevant to GME. I really think you're missing my point and I don't think you'll find a single example of me expressing that shit on here. All of those examples you mentioned are relevant to GME and the posts and comments make a point of that. Please explain to me how a statement like ""I hold popcorn"" is related to GME in any way whatsoever?

Also, sorry if you're butt hurt about it but I haven't down voted any of your posts at all. I'm guessing that's other people who also disagree with you who are doing that.",1636552619,hk2ggeh

"What part of GME only do you not understand? If you want to invest in LRC go ahead, but keep it to yourself. This is not a pump and dump forum. If LRC has intrinsic value it will rise on it's own. How many shitcoins were pumped by the other side of the greatest investment opportunity on earth? Shitloads. They very well could be doing that with LRC. Literally nothing stopping them. If it succeeds, great, but take it elsewhere.",1636551942,hk2f194
"Can everybody calm down a bit in here?

Credentials - GME since Jan, Bitcorn for two years. LRC never.

I have read many, many, **many** posts in here about a crypto-GME link and **trust me** when I say the people here who just like the stock are not selling to buy LRC, nor are they buying it with their pay cheques.

The only apes putting money in it are already in the crypto space, its recent pump is not us, its a small cross section, but mainly speculators in crypto hoping to catch a move by us and the other subs.

There are dozens of scraper tools that follow reddit buzz since Jan. and we’ve triggered the ever loving fuck out of them this past week sending money flying into the project.

Frankly the vast majority of this sub does not know how to buy this thing anyway and I haven’t seen anything even close to an adequate education post to get people to start.

LRC will not entitle you to a dividend, you won’t need to receive or interact with the dividend to benefit from shorts being exposed for failing to pay it, and you won’t benefit from the price squeeze if all you hold is the token native to the chain used to kill the shorts - you need the stock.

Yes it’ll pump, then speculators will rug pull, then somebody will scream:

**this. Is. crypto!** and kick bag holders into a pit. Buy the stock not the coin, and don’t get so sensitive when somebody bashes a coin you like, you won’t last long in the land of FUD with such thin skin OP.

**edit** Fuck me CPI just printed at 6.2%! Its beginning to look a lot like ChristmOas",1636551916,hk2ezby

"I'm not fighting anyone. Just telling you nobody gives a shit about your popcorn. I'm not sure if you've noticed but this is a GME sub and, as many people here including mods have repeatedly pointed out, only discussions of stocks if they are RELATED TO GME are allowed, and only discussions about their relationship. To take LRC as an example, posts are being removed if people claim ""LRC going to $x"" or even just ""I'm holding LRC"". However, posts discussing LRC's relation to GME are not removed. Your comment is irrelevant and you shouldn't be bringing up other stonks here unless you are referring to their relation to GameStop. I'm not sure what's so difficult to understand about that.",1636551893,hk2exoe
"It’s simple. If it’s lrc tech related to gme go for it.  If it’s shillin lrc buying, no.",1636551888,hk2exa3
"OP, LRC is another investment. Your other topics you mention are not. That is why they are allowed.

Until GameStop confirms partnership we should not be here pumping it as if it has anything to do with cornering the shorts on GME and MOASS. Bullish fundamentals have no legitimate price action on a stock that is being manipulated anyways. That's great LRC is skyrocketing but it is not GME. And how do you know HFS are not long on it or pumping it?",1636551792,hk2eqas
"FWIW, I've used Kraken and it's (IMO) trustworthy. Harder to get funds into because the last time I transferred funds I could only do a wire transfer and not an ACH transfer so it took 3-4 days and I had to pay a transfer fee, don't know if that's changed at all but if you have crypto already could always transfer some to Kraken and sell off and buy LRC (NFA, obviously, you do you)",1636551781,hk2epgw
"Even if it is, explain how the price of lrc is connected to the tech used for potential nfts.  It’s just a pump and dump.",1636551646,hk2efjz

Coin circulation with LRC is nearly at 100% with only a small amount in comparison to dog coins for example. I genuinely see a price target of about $10.,1636551219,hk2dk72
"Would it not make more sense for GameStop to mint their own coin rather than using LRC? Even if this new coin were built with loopring tech. Idk, just pondering. Any thoughts?",1636551152,hk2df3z

"I noticed that as welll.. They’ll do anything they can possibly do to divide our buying power, and rn the distraction is CLEARLY LRC",1636550849,hk2ctd8

"Could we get a votation/poll to either ban LRC talk or not? It is causing way much more division than it should, and at the end of the day this is a GME sub. The speculative partnership is used as a excuse to push it along with GME for some reason. As my humble opinnion

"Loopring tokens (LRC) function in part as a type of [governance token](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-are-governance-tokens), so buying and owning them is actually not so different from buying a stake of “ownership of the orchard.” You can start to dig deeper on your own through [Matt Finestone’s January blog post on the official Loopring blog](https://medium.loopring.io/lrc-tokenomics-v2-1e6fd99e9e9c) detailing the functions of Loopring tokens.",1638539711,hn2f6j0
"Frankly we are well due an announcement of future plans. I know that if there is no such announcement then it will be seen by the msm and others that gamestop has no plan going forward. 


All that negativity around. Guess what will happen it will mute out any announcement they make after. And will have very little impact on price. 

As investors we deserve to be told the future plans of gme. We made sure to participate in the votes and vote for RC people. We supported RC and Gamestop massively over this year. Haven't we made sure that us through supporting GME in the way we have. Haven't we prevented the price being tanked. Hasn't that allowed them to have big profit for minimal share dilution. 

That was all us. All we want is to be shown that our investment was worth it and we were right. When GME drops the future for this company. What better time is there to do this than in earnings especially if it all positive news on the earnings side. 

Lrc have said its gonna be worth 10 quarterly reports well you set yourself a Q4 deadline. And we have one month left of Q4. If there shit is involving GME then letting the news of this being released after in a negative storm of press around earnings as always happens. 

Earnings announcement makes the most sense for both companies. And quite frankly none of us want to endure a massive drop like last time. 

I want positive news and plan for the future and some god damn price action.",1638539309,hn2edjm

Great utility in LRC though, can't wait to see this actualize.",1638535533,hn27knn

GME x LRC marriage countdown guy,1638534606,hn264bv
"Good idea, I also think GS can’t give NFT dividend, until the float locked, because the brokers will say ""I don’t know what the fuck NFT is, we can’t do that."" If the float is locked, CS can do it, because we know every other shares at other brokers are fake.
I had a similar idea with DPO and LRC (probably because I have no idea what ERC20 is 😃), but I got downvoted to hell.",1638532533,hn232s4
"I don't even own GME.  How's that?  And it's solely because of the elitism and dismissiveness of this sub toward any other retail investor who even SUGGESTS other stocks are being manipulated (which they obviously are).  So I literally DO NOT BUY GME, because of this sub.  I'm here for LRC only.",1638531064,hn213a5
"Yeah Crypto and NFTs are still a bit over my head, but I do know that the NFT crowd is absolutely clamoring for a cheaper way to keep NFT's and LRC is supposedly going to offer a solution to that with said free counterfactual wallet. Exciting!",1638529305,hn1yun8
I was specifically looking at price because that's how everyone talked about it. Saying LRC was a much cheaper GME. I saw lots of chatter like that so I made the post. It seems those people are the minority so I rest my case,1638525781,hn1un07

All the talk around the US government saying Bitcoin undermines the USD and how the cryptocurrency sub is removing all LRC posts so that when the MOASS happens they can blame crypto for the financial system collapse and push their narrative that crypto = bad and USD and stock markets = good!,1638490706,hn04huj
"The crypto community has predicted the greatest transference of wealth in human history is coming just like we say with GME.  I started with GME but have become more successful with crypto.

I feel like crypto will blow up after MOASS due to people being fed up with wall street.  If it's because of NFT marketplace or dividend, I foresee apes going into it even harder.  

I think mainstream projects will go crazy.  Shib and LRC will far exceed expectations.  People unfamiliar with crypto will go with what they have heard about on the news.

Last year, btc more then 2x this time of year.  Might just be a coincidence but this run started around Dec options and ended day of Jan 2021 monthlies.  All crypto ran hard during this time so I don't want to miss out on the momentum in the space, if it repeats.  

I'm a follower of gherk I think that they may have ran up crypto to combat the cycle last year.  If they are more fucked this year, wouldn't they run it harder?  Haven't people been saying BTC to $100k by EOY?  Laugh if ETH surpasses BTC like Kenny called.

Problem I foresee is the Evergrande collapse.  Speculation is tether is tied to it, very bad if so.  I also find it strange that Dr Metzler called 17th as a potential end date, Dec option date.  This date started the crypto run last year but what if Evergrande collapses and takes tether with it?

What if China shuts off that exit for wall street?  This could potentially lead to a major collapse for America.  So many crazy what ifs and realistically I could see either, or neither happening.

Crypto will inevitably recovery but that money will basically be trapped until then.  Even knowing that the gains are so significant it's worth the risks.  It's to much opportunity to miss out on.  I still hold 7-ish figures in crypto and been moving cash over to DRS weekly.  I believe GME is the real deal but also believe defi is the future.  Soon, it'll be what came first, GME or defi?  Not the chicken or the egg, that's how hand in hand these things are.",1638490296,hn03llt

"Still a lot of questions for me. Like for a digital game there is no difference between a new and ""used"" version. Unless you are selling progress, in game items, expansions with a ""used"" version. And the economics of buying and selling a digital game, essentially its just like swapping the game after a period of time for another game. Almost feels like a rental model or a gamefly model. Pay a subscription, get any 5 games, swap any game you are done with out for a different game whenever you want etc.

I think the gaming industry is evolving away from the old pay for the game model entirely. Free to play or subscription based online games with in game commerce seem to be the way we are heading. Immersive ""infinite"" games that you continue playing for years and years. LOL, WOW, fortnite, I think the NFTs are going to deal with those in game ecosystems, in game items, upgrades, expansions, skins, whatever. And using crypto to power the commerce across multiple games, so your LRC or ETH can be used in whatever game you are playing right then.

Buying a game, playing it through 100% then selling it and getting another one...I wonder if that model is even going to survive.",1638475865,hmz3i8h

"Tbh.. there was a different screenshot (there is one actually - a Github picture) which actually has the payload and elements defined. That particular screenshot co relates to my sentence above…

Now coming to the 2nd screenshot of OP’s post I can tin foil the below..

How much code I could see based on that I understood the below…
—————————-
First half of code

* Fetching user info , fetching exchange info ( which application they r going to use to process this transaction), whitelisteduserapi (a specific filter for a set of accounts- normally done in most business cases to distinguish a group of users from others)

* Const = is nothing but setting a constant variable - it’s like a placeholder 

- Following data is being fetched 
User info , exchange info and whitelisteduserapi

————————————-

Mid half of Code where it starts with “it”

- Here, they are checking if the user account info they fetched is present or not. 

- if(!accInfo) means “ if no account info is present”

- return = do nothing

- const {exchangeInfo} = placing exchange info data into a placeholder with name exchangeInfo

—————————————-

Final half of visible code

const request : NFTWithdraw… blah blah!!!????

- I believe all the data the was fetched from line number 1 until now is being placed in a payload. 

The code structure u see from “minGas” to end of the code? 

- I think this is how the data was requested to be represented.

What is a Payload? 
- A structure defined to place all data that was fetched earlier and place it in a format that can be readable on the endpoint system.) 

- mingas = 0 prolly test instance so they manually set it to 0

- exchange, account id, to, owner - placeholders for data 

- token - placeholder for token info (LRC Info maybe or an NFT token which is ready to be withdrawn after setting up the GameStop details)

* token id - damn sure this is gonna be unique
* nftdata- system specific user id- unique to every token generated I suppose or withdrawn

* amount - how many?

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Looks like a token being withdrawn from a exchange server which can be an NFT with 0 gas fees.

This token can be a lot or a single generated nft.. 

Ok I am done .. I might be completely wrong or anything.. but I am sure I am not 💯 wrong

"Hey apes,

i have another theory why they may be dropping the price to around 170$ or 180$ once in a while. I think they are simply testing retails liquidity. We all know a lot of apes recently put their money into LRC when the price of GME was between 200-250$. I threw 500€ into LRC too. For that i could've bought 2-3 shares of GME - shame on me. Maybe they thought apes are not willing to put more money into GME and they tested different levels over the last days. 175$ seems to be the level apes start buying GME again in masses. I caught myself buying more shares at that point which i probably would've thrown into LRC again, when the price still would've been over 200$. 

tl;dr 

They are testing if apes are still willing to buy their favorite company and it seems they encounter serious buying power at 175$.",1638465342,hmyc97q

"Sorry about the paraphrasing ..I'll try to be more specific..but . Here a little back story of me .. normally I am free lancer but January a boss begged me to go salary and stay on then worked me till I received very substantial injur and  put me into bed left on workers comp denied proper treatment ..the injury was to my neck shoulder and back.

 ..the neck injury has cause a form of dislecia  ..so I'm having a bit of trouble all of a sudden  ..it also pulled on the optic nerve which created a bit of a vision problem in my right eye and I lost a bunch of my motor skills in my dominant hand and that side of my body ..

so all of a sudden I'm using the left side of my brain way more and am trying to understand things I have not even ever considered .. 

..I think well I got this settlement pennies compared to what I deserve and I tell myself I have to find a place to invest for the first time in my life .I've always been on the medical cannabis /rec side of cannabis where it began..and am og rebel ..I see apes hooting and holding all over and I say I can get behind this 

.normally if I wasn't stuck in bed I wouldn't even use the internet accept to pay bills and do research on regulation law and technique's product so on so forth ..so bear with me I'm trying to catch up as fast as possible .this why I say I'm a out dated model ..

.appreciate the discord link and I will add you on discord . thankyou ..  so now I look to educate myself as fast and as correctly as possible ...but I see that I need guidance and I'm a quick study ...out all the hrs of DD and blogs I've read yours is the most simplified statements and open about taking questions..this tell me you have good intentions in clearing up alot of the fud and misconception and tinfoil theories flying about ..

..Im excited and motivated to understand and interact as much as possible ..I'm all in and looking to the future with a new found excitement of what the future could be ..but honestly I'm am very far behind ..and looking to follow others that are more familiar and educated in this area then I know I am...this is how I mastered cannabis game and eventually trained others day and night but I'm tired of that and looking to expand my horizons..

Thank you for confirming that waiting for fractional wallet is a patient and correct move.

Luckily I went all in on lrc at .36 dumped the lit  of other crypto and took a leap ..well that may have been the best decision I have made all year besides gme and drs and buckling up ..

"I've been speculating in my head about Gamestop releasing a dividend that hedgies \_could\_ pay in order to bleed them of liquidity.  ie. if GS knows there are 2 billion (est.)  synthetic shares floating around out there, they release a dividend, perhaps in LRC that the hedgies CAN pay but might cost them a LOT to buy, and watch as Citadel et al have to come up with crazy amounts of money to pay out all the synthetics they've created while at the same time not even closing those synthetics.  In effect GS forcing their can kicking to cost a lot of money, and that LRC just increases in value as these huge buys are happening for pay out, and continues to rise as the marketplace is announced etc.  So that the hedgies have some major incentive to close short positions before the next dividend comes out...

I like that play, even if it's not a unique NFT dividend, that can be held out as a threat for future dividends still, and ALL apes all get a nice early slice of LRC courtesy of hedge finds having to cover a dividend.",1638463064,hmy6ag3

Agreed.  Also the price of LRC is irrelevant to if GME and Loopring can launch their project.   Buying LRC is just and investment because you believe in the project.    What you want to invest-in is your own business.,1636562740,hk34u7e

"Ok. Heavy crypto investor also holding GME. 

Let me start with agreeing that gain porn shouldn’t be allowed. 

However…

I have money that is tied to crypto. It’s not being cashed out and being moved to GME. They are long term investments and I don’t need or want to cash it out to buy GME. It’s dedicated to crypto. Then I have my stock investment funds that are dedicated to stock. Just like I have a fund to pay my bills that doesn’t go to GME. 

While I’m not liquidating crypto to buy GME, I absolutely have traded into LRC and it’s been a fantastic move so far. It’s all but been announced that LRC and GameStop are working together via released code. There is no reason I see that the partnership shouldn’t be discussed be discussed and that people who have a similar crypto fund shouldn’t be allowed to see that information and invest according to their own research, partly what is posted here. 

Look GME is the play. But LRC is the field on which it takes place. It’s likely to be a highly lucrative venture on both fronts and investing in LRC is investing in the future of GameStop tech and the longevity of its success. Don’t write it off because “bUt iTs nOt GME aNd tHiS sUb iS GME oNlY!” If everything that we seen in the code is factual, these two are so joined at the hip at this point that success in one is only going to benefit the other. Remember while this is, of course, all about the MOASS - people who want to see them absolutely dominate more than just the gaming market would be foolish to be angry that people are investing in LRC. 

One closing note: for those that are using crypto gains to buy GME, a note on the timeline of likely events if hypothetically things go the way we expect. 

1) LRC has said that they have a massive Q4 announcement - for the sake of this argument, let’s say it’s the best case scenario and it’s a partnership with GameStop to create a platform (whether it be NFT game licensing and resale, and exchange, a blockchain stock market, etc). Whatever it is, they make the announcement Q4

2) People instantly realize the value of the partnership. Millions FOMO in all but instantly jacking the price through the roof. 

3) MOASS likely lags at least a couple days beyond this even ESPECIALLY if this announcement is after market close on a Friday. 

4) cash out you LRC gains and set Monday morning buy orders to get in before shot starts popping off. 


Just my 0.02 and an attempt to have people step back and see the bigger picture that extends beyond MOASS.",1636561999,hk32ueq

Some of you are so stubborn you’re going to learn a hard lesson and kick yourself for not buying under $1 or where it is now.",1636561408,hk31cn3
Yes it is. Because that coin mooning is huge publicity for GME. LRC people are already starting to buy GME. I think most people who know agree with me. We unfortunately have this loud minority who thinks they should be allowed to censor relevant GME talk.,1636561391,hk31ay6
"Agreed. LRC is likely to be a good stock and even I’d be interested if I had the money, but there’s no benefit in discussing that in the GME subs.",1636561385,hk31aeh
Wym Citadel can’t touch? Citadel most certainly can buy LRC and dump it.,1636561251,hk30yf3
"Can you link me to that wallet? I'm deep in LRC and have not heard of this. 
I thought people figured out that someone had sent LRC to the GME wallet but that was all it was. And anyone could've sent those LRC.
Has there been anything new besides that?",1636561167,hk30qnx
"DRS and Computershare (which is a ticker traded company) is the greatest derailment/slide in the short history of this sub.  

LRC at this point is a godsend",1636561139,hk30o5t
"GME Owners will see a ROI for LRC regardless, in order to host a L2 exchange you need to hold a lot of LRC. What that means is that GME is probably buying up lots of LRC (if they have not already). Obviously this isn’t represented in share price because of Kenny and co / the fact it’s unconfirmed. 

We recently saw job listings for a “blockchain accountant” or something along those lines which in my opinion sounds a lot like they’re going to have crypto assets on the books much like Tesla did. If that’s the case then if gme bought LRC at a super low price then that’d be represented in the accounting and gme should move up based on fundamentals. Again that’s in a fictional market devoid of crime, but I guess we’ll see what happens…",1636561077,hk30ik4
"OP not everyone talking about LRC is a shill, paranoid much?",1636561022,hk30dmi
"Im all in on GME but im also all in on LRC? 

That means your half in on GME and half in on LRC",1636561017,hk30d4z
Keep it GME related Only. No LRC gains posts. That’s a distraction from DRS,1636560991,hk30at7
"Separate entities is not correct. The functionality enabled by L2 rollup, like say NFT stock certificates, is inextricably linked to the coin LRC. I respect your position on discussing alternate investments, it’s a fine line on this one. Nuts to ban GameStop’s chosen rebuttal to the crime!",1636560936,hk305y9
The sooner people realize LRC = GME the better. So many of you are being so stubborn you’re pissing away opportunities to make money.,1636560935,hk305vs
"Got in and out of LRC for some quick profits. TA show'd some signs of weakness, didn't get out at top, but at least some decent gains. Looking it put it back into some GME now 🚀🚀🚀🚀",1636560873,hk300dv
"What, you dont want to dump money into LRC or WSKY??????

What would you rather have? 1 GME worth millions? or a few coins worth hundreds? Ill take the coin, thanks,",1636560861,hk2zzao
"&gt; I don't want to discuss it further than this is a GME sub, only.

That's just objectively wrong, we discuss so much more than GME here.
That said I don't think gain posts should be allowed, only links/DD between GME and LRC.",1636560820,hk2zvnf
That is not confirmed. LRC and loopring are technically separate entities.,1636560641,hk2zfnz
 gamestop has yet to announce its  gonna b used yes leaks point to it but this is still not 100% proven. LR prob but will that coin b linked to gme? we dont actually know. bullying would imply its a gme/lrc sub,1636560615,hk2zddu
"I upvoted you to posture your point. I totally agree the loopring posts should be scaled back entirely. This is a GME sub. Until loopring partnership is confirmed or denied it shouldn't be plastered all over SuperStonk everyday. To the other ape I replied to, we are not a gang of Investors. If apes want to take their hand in making more money to make their lives more comfortable, to lean away from the anxiety of inflation and winter time right around the corner, extra funds could be a saving grace for some. Again posts about LRC on stonk or jungle should be scaled back, as per the rules. But negative sentiment towards apes trying to live comfortably now instead of later should be thought upon. I love you all. And I see your perspectives. Making loop money only bolsters my ability to hold indefinitely, I hope you understand.",1636560596,hk2zblw
"Loopring yes, LRC, less so. But yes, that is the synopsis on my point, no gain posts. We don't allow it for anything else so what is the difference?",1636560573,hk2z9me
"I don't think anyone is saying you shouldn't be happy that LRC has made you profit. They're just saying don't do it *here*, in a GME subreddit. Hit up the crypto subs, LoopRing's own sub, you know, places where the price of LRC is actually relevant.

SuperStoked you've made a sound investment somewhere else. Please celebrate it, somewhere else.",1636560537,hk2z6bw
"Soo many downvotes here. I think Both sides have great points, but can’t this one strand here where Op is clearly starting a discussion on this be a little more nice? 

LRC folks are apes. Apes together! This movement is big enough to fit both groups with different ways of showing support to GMe and their partners. 

A good discussion about how the forums should focus is great! But it is curious why Evergrande is talked about all the time. I do not give a fuck about that and it’s cringy AF with so many people suffering. And if you say it’s because it can cause margin and this and that through a series of interrelated correlations it’s related GmE, then LRC can be talked about (in a non shill way) as it’s associated with the direct future of GmE. We talk about GmE fundamentals all the time, and LRC fits into that.",1636560535,hk2z65t
Stay over they’re with that bullshit lrc what the hell is that bruh,1636560461,hk2yzhi
"Loopright might me, LRC is absolutely not.  Now get lost.",1636560345,hk2yotl
"Well I had enough spare for 6 GME, now, with the dip, I've got enough for 34 GME. That's why I'd invest money in LRC.",1636560329,hk2yne5
"This place is supposed to be about theoretical discussions revolving around GME. Showing gains I do not agree with, but speculating on or looking into the relationship of GME and LRC, if there even is one, I believe should be welcomed. Just my opinion tho",1636560256,hk2ygqg
It’s okay to like both. Just go talk about LRC on their own sub,1636560189,hk2yaj9
"All my cash is in on GME. But coinbase does a cool learn and earn function. I've been converting everything I get to LRC. Because why wouldn't I? It's working out so far. Either way, I'm out nothing but time while I wait for the MOASS anyway. 🚀💎💪🦍🤘💎🚀🍻",1636560065,hk2xzbl
"I'd like to go on record with my position of Loopring/LRC being discussed in here, fwiw. 

Based on the hiring of Matt Finestone, [nft.gamestop.com](https://nft.gamestop.com), Loopring announcing a premium partner in Q4, and the source code leak on GitHub (which to me is the most satisfactory of it all, and also why boomers haven't piled in yet because wut github?) .... I think it is to our benefit to discuss our little brother company. That is the premise for my next opinion. 

It is hard to discuss little brother company without discussing their token valuation and skyrocketing trendline. It is exactly what would be happening to our beloved stock, sans Citadel and SHFs imo. 

I also think that since shills have sniffed this out as a potentially divisive issue and they get off on that shit, they are going to spam 'yay LRC' and 'no moar Loopring' posts to get it shut down. Why? I'm glad you asked. 

1. Because the more people that are aware of it and independently choose to join in, the less control they have over this. LRC is exploding, and where do you think those tendies are going to go soon? I'm pretty sure it's a quick way to raise capital for all kinds of things, you know since we've been patiently waiting over here for the big one. I've 8-bagged in 2 weeks and expect much more, and those profits are coming straight into GME very soon. 
2. Knowledge is power. This is a move to suppress information and keep the sub in a knowledge silo again. 

I disagree with posting positions, gains, losses etc. That is bullshit and should not be allowed. 

Let's support little brother stock and use it to our advantage. This is not the time to divide.",1636560046,hk2xxmz
LRC BABY,1636560045,hk2xxjb
For everyone arguing about LRC I think it’s cool to post about it in relation to GME and if you buy it that’s cool but try to keep gains posts and unrelated stuff to a minimum since GME is the main character here :),1636559982,hk2xrw2
Can we put the banning of LRC gains into the sub? Especially if it isn't related to the one true Superstonk?,1636559977,hk2xred
So I’m flipped my helium to lrc and made solid profits…. Guess where that goes? Gme…. Use other investments to make more money faster and put that into gme… not financial advice,1636559854,hk2xgc6
Nope.  Mods have positions in LRC so pumping the coin here is ok now.,1638028543,hma9puv
"A large well-funded startup, like GameStop, would use their own token, not a third-party token like LRC.",1638028501,hma9mjg
Hope folks don't get burnt misguidedly buying LRC.,1638028325,hma98oj
"And anyone with a pair of eyes can see how forced LRC is on this sub, with all the hints and winks coming from Loopring's side, and dozens of apologists, none of them convincing.",1638028017,hma8k8x
What is a realistic price for lrc in the next six months?,1638027945,hma8eqm
"But he is trying to force the association using dfv as a tie in which is cringey and sus as fuck.

Peoppe really gotta replace lrc with popcorn, wish, rocket, literally any other distraction and get their head outta their asses when trying to divert into quick short term pump coin plays.",1638027765,hma80pb
Fuck you made me buy more lrc,1638027555,hma7jwm
"I put $100 in it a while back and I won’t sell that, but i’m not buying more. Gme is deflationary, and shares are evaporating by the day as more people drs. One day, very soon, much sooner than lrc, the float will be locked up.

Lrc will be pumping and dumping for years and years, much like btc, which is also deflationary and a popular hedge fuckery tool. 

No one in retail is making money on btc right now i’ll tell you that much.",1638027481,hma7e0v
So I found a blogpost by loopring saying to buy eth in uphold then transfer that to binance for the lrc and then you could hold lrc in the loopring wallet but they won’t take my fidelity debit card or PayPal so now I’m waiting on my credit Union to get me my new debit card,1638027344,hma73ap
This isn't really the place to discuss it. There is an LRC sub as well as other crypto subs.,1638027285,hma6yla
"Swap another token in Metamask, assuming you're only being cock blocked for LRC by Uphold.",1638026978,hma6b40
"Could be because this is a GME board and not a loopring board.

Loopring are a completely different entity. The, and I want be clear, *speculation* around it is fine but it is speculation. Speculation about a different company, posted on GME board. Remember other companies with ""potential partnerships"" that never materialised?

We've seen this sort of thing *a lot*. Until there's an announcement it is all speculation and distraction (read forum sliding).

Recently there have been a lot of posts pushing LRC without anything to do with GME. Much akin to when popcorn kept getting pushed. 

Unless it is *directly related to GME* it doesn't belong here. Discuss possible integrations on the LR sub. That's what it's there for.",1638025952,hma46fq
"I was just noticing recently, a lot of top dog crypto’s crashed a bit on 10/26-10/27 and a ton of smaller cryptos pumped on 10/28, including LRC.

I can’t help but to speculate, someone/institutions trying to get ahead of the curve, someone will tons of wealth.

Trust me I want to get some LRC for myself but I’m waiting for crypto wallets to be more accessible. So until then, I feel safe assuming LRC is a SHF pump, at least at the moment",1638025400,hma3125

I would be more jack3d if things weren’t different this time. Repo is insanely different and I bet they found other ways to be lame ass hedgefucks. My tits will stay unmilked until RC and LRC do the magic pp dance soon.,1638003413,hm987vr
I’d rather gamble the money on buying LRC at that point. It has a better chance of making short term profit than GME calls lol,1638001290,hm95okf

"I am a software engineer by trade, and if you comb through my post history you can find my GitHub/LinkedIn, my assessment is the GME hires for those positions are for implementation of the data contracts between the services of the two companies. GME would have to add that minimum headcount to containerize partnership implementation inhouse of a defined partnership. They would still need the underlying service foundation. Inventing the LRC tech and services independently, in addition to their current scope, would add like T+12 months to the software iteration cycle at the minimum.

Do with that perspective what you will. Hopefully it helps you acknowledge a duck for a duck.",1637990187,hm8pv0r
"Synchronicity is seeing the same thing over and over because your brain is subconsciously or consciously looking for that pattern or number. Like when you're looking at a new car, then start to see it everywhere. ex: ""I was driving to a Gamestop and saw a license plate with 741! Simulation confirmed!"" It's the connection between the subjective and objective. 

Synchronicity holds true when looking at the broader world, we could all find SOMETHING. But when 741/147 has numerous, relevant correlations to SEC filings, GME filings, ETH/LRC and they've only come from Ryan Cohen, on one Medium Twitter, then that's not coincidence it's purposefully execited.",1637988392,hm8ms7w

"If GME is using LR for its marketplace setup, my understanding is they wil have to stake tokens to do so. And its a massive amount of tokens.

I'm a bit dense.",1637891450,hm3sk9q

"Guys if you have LRC you NEED to be transferring it to a cold wallet.

I wouldn't trust these shifty central exchanges at all.

I have 90% of my LRC in cold storage. Thank God I do because you know what?

I went to transfer the remaining 10% today.

The transfer still hasn't reached my cold wallet (over 12 hours now) but it's ""gone"" from my Coinbase wallet.

It's pretty damn obvious they ""held"" LRC for me that they didn't actually possess the cheeky bastards.

I got a glorified IOU and I'm now completely reliant on Coinbase to honour their side of the deal.

Really pissed off, Looprings DEX can't come soon enough!!

Sorry for being completely smooth on this..",1637889638,hm3p2ht
My main question here is how does coinbase not having sufficient lrc an issue. If people are withdrawing then the lrc already exists on the exchange in their hot and cold wallet. They don't need to borrow lrc as they are not in the business of providing it. They simply allow you to trade with other uses and take a fee each trade.,1637889563,hm3oxeo

U can also buy eth on meta and convert to lrc I’m told.",1637889211,hm3o9nv

So buy LRC?,1637889073,hm3o0h9
"The github ""leak"" was just a URL and some words that line up with GME, but nothing that PROVES they are linked together.

Why would GME setup all of these secrecy provisions, and let LRC ""leak"" all of the recent info? Doesnt make sense to me. That would be telegraphing your moves, something RC explicitly said he doesnt do.

IMO, there is about a 30% chance this partnership is real, 70% its just to pump LRC.",1637888671,hm3n9io
You mean like Eth to MM and then Eth to LRC in L2?,1637888604,hm3n51t
"Can someone ELI5 what happened? Coinbase is an exchange where people buy coins...I get that.

"it would cost you up to like $20 to move off exchange which is basically like drsing. You would want to download the metamask app and then send coins to your wallet address. 

You can also use the Loopring wallet but then you have to set up a Loopring wallet which can cost like $150. Not really worth it unless your playing w fat stacks. 

If you did go the metamask route you would eventually have to onboard onto Loopring which might mean you can’t use the wallet app and have to do it through the metamask. Not sure how the whole ecosystem will come together tbh. There would prob be a cost to onboard onto loopring layer 2. 

All these costs are ethereum costs not gas costs. From a new users perspective all of it would be free once the free wallet comes out cause you can onboard directly to layer 2 using a debit card. 

Centralized exchanges like gemini might even enable onboarding w the crypto you have on them. 

Honestly it’s all up to you. It’s not entirely clear what the best decision would be for someone who has lrc on a centralized exchange. Whether you wanna participate in locking up the float, care about fees,",1637886377,hm3iwke

Coinbase is only 7.5% of the lrc volume. I dont think this guy understands how small a player coinbase is in the cex market. They can't suppress the price when most of the lrc trading happens elsewhere,1637886142,hm3ih3s
"I can definitely see your side to this. On the other end, if you were Loopring, (which is not an anonymous project btw so developer identities are not unknown) why risk tainting your game changing project, your name, and future career in the block chain universe?

"I'd just like to point out 1 glaring fault in that premise. 

Crypto is NOT like the share market. Traditional markets operate on a centralised market model. There is usually 1 exchange that the instrument is traded on. 

With crypto, it is DECENTRALISED..... This means that every CEX (Centralised Exchange) operates as its own centralised market. If you open up say 3 exchanges all on the same cross trading pair, you will notice that all 3 are trading a slightly different values. 

If you go to the following link and click on 'Markets' you can see a general snapshot of what Im talking about but for confirmation, physically open up a few exchanges on same cross pair charts and check their trading behaviour side by side. 

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/loopring/markets/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/loopring/markets/)

At the time of writing Loopring was trading as follows for LRC/USDT cross trading pair: 

Binance = $3.34

Gate.io = $3.36

Huobi Global = $3.33

MEXC = $3.32

This might not seem like much with Loopring trading at $3 range.... but go check out the same thing with BTC/USDT cross pair 

Binance = $58,818.56

Gate.io = $58,828.60

Huobi Global = $58,827.43

Kucoin = $58,825.86
 

Usually, arbitrage traders will keep the different exchanges tracking around the same values (buy low on 1 exchange and sell high on another and pocket the profit. This creates buying pressure on the low exchange and selling pressure on the high exchange and brings them back to close to parity). 

Usually what a CEX will do is facilitate trading between customers on their own CEX platform. If however there is a sudden spike in buying volume of say.... Loopring but no one on the CEX is selling Loopring, the CEX then has to go to 1 of the other CEX's and purchase it from there, then transfer back to their own CEX, then fill the customers order. 

(If I recall correctly, the majority of CEX's use Binance for this type of service purely because Binance is the largest CEX with the most liquidity in each market..... But Binance has and does run into liquidity issues in some markets during big news events. If no one on their platform wishes to buy when everyone's trying to sell and cap their losses, the trade stays open and people experience so huge losses at times.) 

Now I haven't looked into Coinbase that much or these issues around Loopring.... but what I SUSPECT (not fact) is that Coinbase doesn't have the nessacery liquidity on the Coinbase CEX to facilitate the market as they have had a influx of Apes all wanting to BUY and HODL Loopring. So they are halting trading, taking a block order to the wider market and hitting other CEX's to buy up the volume of LRC they need for their own customers. 

I would be willing to bet they are also trying to forecast future demand and buy up extra Loopring to hold in reserve so that there is volume avalible to keep the Coinbase Loopring market functioning but on the same hand they don't want to tie up their cash being a bag holder if the demand suddenly stops. I think market making (being the buyer/seller) is a last resort for most CEX's, their goal is to provide the platform for their customers to trade with each other and take a commission for every single transaction.",1637881859,hm3a3yl

"It's frustrating. People are so scared to understand it because someone months ago said ""options just give SHFs free money"". Well of course they do if you're buying calls for 600 strike. Unfortunately, those are also cheapest and people got burned. AKA Warden.

I've bought BB calls because they are the cheapest ""meme stock' calls. Guess where the money is going after I excersise then sell the shares at a profit? GME. I get first hand experience with options too.

As you said, and as we know, MOASS is a matter of when. But I'd rather do what I can to make money asap to buy more shares, do my part, trigger moass and pay off my house. I'm getting stuck in how I can whether it's in LRC, having shares DRSd, left in every other broker. I'm having decent success even though I'm not rich, but I'm not getting success by upvoting a purple ring every second. I actually read the DD and try to understand shit.

Excellent reply. More info on the protocol: https://blogs.loopring.org/lrc-utility-in-loopring-3-0/. LRC can be staked to receive a portion of protocol fees in LRC. If the price increases then those staking rewards are worth more. You can sorta think of it as a badass dividend for supporting the protocol.

"I would agree that a DEX is probably preferable, but that requires you already have bought Crypto with fiat first. Uniswap and others like it don't have an on-ramp for cash so they're not a great choice for beginners dipping their toes in for the first time.

The reason for the LRC push imo is because of what they'll be bringing to the table not for just GME but trading as a whole. Which is what was needed because of the fuckery going on by hedges/brokers. And they're definitely working together on this both execs wanting to completely reinvent the market.

So 20 days before the 1 year anniversary of the OG 💩 tweet, we get another 💩 without blockbuster. Is this a signal of things to come? Well remember how there's been talk of a 10 day wait period where GME x LRC have to give regulatory agencies a 10 day warning before making an official partnership.

 Well if RC and company want to maximize damage to those SHF, then announcing their intent to enter a partnership to the world might be one powerful nail on the coffin.  Dec. 27th is 10 days to Jan.6th, and a fantastic way to compound into retail FOMO, as well as increased retail spending power due to the season (XMAS BONUSES ANYONE???).",1640383163,hpurqio

"my wombo-combo whack-a-doodle theory:  The fundamentals stay solid, GME continues to have solid retail into the new year, this xmas's earnings being really good.  

End of January happens and a shit-ton of can-kicking T+whatever's come around and create some upward price pressure, people are cautiously stoked.  Loopring announces big things followed shortly thereafter by GME announcing partnership, but not yet letting slip what they're working on together specifically, everyone's really stoked.  

Then GME announces their earnings beginning of Feb.  they are stellar, everyone's stoked again, especially when GME releases the DRS count again and it's more than doubled, we're now within 10mil shares of DRS'ing the 33mil share public float, DRS'ing intensifies as Roth/IRA folks finally get off their asses en mass.  

Just after earnings GME announces a dividend, but combines the announcement with another Loopring partnership tease and says the dividend is going to be paid in LRC into the counterfactial fiat-enabled loopring wallets but in a new GME interface that's slick as fuck, everyone is so fucking stoked and DRS'ing kicks into high gear.  Hedgies have to pay out the dividend in the cash equivalent to the LRC dividend, but LRC is now climbing sue to all the positive shit going on.  This bleeds the SHF of a ton of cash because they now have to cover the billions of synthetic shares that are floating around.  Everyone who has not DRS'd yet feels good because they got some cash and everyone who did DRS feels good because they got some LRC.  Everyone is still stoked.  

SHF are hurting for liquidity now because of how much they had to pay out in dividends to cover short positions, meanwhile the market is starting to crash because Evergrande has finally defaulted again and media is now starting to let folks know how many banks hold a ton of chinese real estate bonds.  Margin calls start on smaller SHF and price pressure rises, FOMO starts while people see GME rising through much of the downturn. GME announces GMErica is splitting off from Gamestop to provide the world the marketplace, and to kick it off, an NFT dividend of Wu-Tang greatness, Bill Murray volunteers to make this announcement holding a stuffed groundhog, the same day  RC buys the last remaining public float of \~9mil shares, apes go nuts, DFV tweets a congrats to RC and a cheers to the apes, we collectively blow our respective loads.  

DRS'ing ramps up so much Computershare has to dedicate an entire building and staff just to GME related business, MOASS ensues and continues for 6 months while two more dividends get paid out in LRC at each earnings quarter, with apes making bank off MOASS'ing synthetics, and LRC dividends on DRS'd infinity pool shares.  

Kenny does a perp walk on Fox News, Stevie and the Susquahanna gambler do the perp walk on MSNBC, Vlad disappears somewhere in Bulgaria after fleeing the continent.  Milken has a heart attack and his funeral is attended only by close family because no one wants to associate with him anymore now that his money is gone.

2022 turns out to be a real headfuck for the public as they watch the financial system crumble and yet there are people in their community taking care of shit with tendies, businesses and non-profits keep showing up to help out, each of them somehow working ""ape"" into the title.  Things couldn't be worse off with everyone's money being worthless, businesses closing and laying people off, but just as fast, people are getting hired by the ape businesses and NGO's, getting paid in crypt-0, and the food bank's never been better stocked.  Housing is getting built and sold at reasonable prices out of sustainable materials.

Everything you’ve done is perfectly fine but here is how it works. Your LRC is in coinbase on layer 1(L1). You can pay to have a loopring wallet made on L1 and then pay to transfer your LRC across L1 from coinbase’s wallet to yours. Then you have a loopring wallet layer 2 (L2)made for free that is connected to your L1 but you have to pay to move your LRC from L1 to L2. This is all very expensive and a complicated. Yesterday loopring released a way to buy LRC directly with your free L2 wallet using a credit card.

Yup crypto currency had been actively suppressing LRC which is ironic and hilarious since crypto is supposed to end centralization. Why most invest in crypto to begin with. At least anyone who backs the technology,1640136606,hpi1c36
I wouldn’t quite say LRC traded flat.  Got a nice little pop at the announcement of the on ramp.  Besides that spot on.  Keep up the good work ape.,1640135909,hphzt2v

"I don't think I explained my thoughts well enough. No FUD intended fellow ape.  


My logic is **not** that there will be no GME squeeze, it's that in this example LRC will \***also**\* moon alongside GME.

Someone posted today that SI is over 1900%. At a float of 75m (using round numbers here bc im lazy), this means there are over 1.4b naked shorts. 

SHFs are liable for the dividend on every naked short they make. In a monetary dividend situation, that's fine because they would pay out cash (as you said in your example). But in a 1:1 LRC-to-GME crypto-dividend situation, SHFs would have to go and find an actual LRC they would have to pass on to shareholders. This means they are on the hook to find 1.4b LRC. 

But LRC has a finite limited supply of 1.3b coins in total. Trying to find 1.4b LRC means in their process of trying to pass on the cryp0-dividend there will be a fuck-ton of SHF demand for LRC causing an LRC moon.

My speculation in this hypothetical scenario is once SHFs get closer and closer to the 1.3b LRC limit, they will realise they can no longer pass on an LRC and be forced to go to the DTCC with their pants down and admit how fukt they are.

My comment around the 7:1 LRC-to-GME ratio is that if there are 1.4b shorts, then they would have to find almost 10b LRC tokens, therefore causing moon sooner.

Wow so LRC literally gets free demand.,1640129430,hphliuq
It is also fully possible for a DEX to develop organically because of LRC bringing the traffic to L2.  It could be LRC or GME or someone else.  I see it as Loopring busting down the wall to L2 and now the market is open to whoever wants to operate there.,1640129242,hphl3pj
With all the releases by LRC today how could those products benefit GME? I’m sorry if this his been asked a million times I just don’t understand specifics and a counterfactual wallet for example would benefit Gamestop and consequently us,1640129186,hphkz5e

By your logic the squeeze would be on LRC since shorts would be forced to go to the market and buy LRC, to cover this hypothetical dividend.

At your stated 1b short positions, That would take 21 billion dollars to cover the dividend and kick the can further down the road. Thats a drop in the bucket compared to moass. 

Just with my xx shares I should be getting about 9% of that total drop in the bucket.

"Since I just did this all in the last hour I'll give you my breakdown of how I got my Coinbase balance transferred to L2. 

So, first you'll need a wallet (if your just using Coinbase as a broker). I was learning this all on my own so here's my roundabout way. I created a coinbase wallet using the Coinbase app. From there I created an account with MetaMask. This is essential in connecting your coinbase wallet to the L2 app. Once you have your coinbase wallet and MetaMask set up, you'll want to send all your tokens from the Coinbase app to your Coinbase Wallet. Those will reflect in your MetaMask addon (im using Firefox). From there Navigate to the Loopring app page, and find where it says to connect a wallet. Once you hit connect with MetaMask, your MetaMask addon will pop up and ask you to confirm permission. Confirm and you're pretty much done. Your Coinbase wallet is now connected to your L2 wallet. There are gas fees in there, and then some transfer fees if you're depositing into pools. Also, I don't think the On Ramp is working yet. When you attempt to  convery Fiat to Crypto it says ""No assets available"" meaning there isn't anything to buy yet WITH the fiat. 

Anyways, I hope this helps. If not, im sorry. I'm sure there are easier ways, but this is how I did it.

LRC is far from the first project to be blacklisted. When we blacklisted IOTA and VET, their admins sorted it out. They filtered links, warned the community and fostered an attitude that doesn’t actually encourage brigading.
There are still tens of threads live on Loopring sub either inciting hatred against CC mods or encouraging people to martyr their accounts - proof the admins of LRC socials don’t care about our rules.

"You got to understand what nfts actually are first. In its current state nft space is pretty useless: as you dont own the artwork but hyperlink to the artwork( the contract). I repeat you dont own the treasure but you own only the unique map that leads to the treasure. The artwork is off chain (most of the time). Anyone with access to the hosted hyperlink space (not the buyer of the nft)  can replace the artwork with anything. An nft is like a remote inbox. You dont own or control anything inside the inbox. But just the inbox.  Wich is basically inciting spam and abuse. There is currently no actual usecase for it.  

That said. 
Take for example any game you can buy on steam or in a shop. You can own the disc or download it. But you dont actually own the game.  But You bought and own  a license to play the game. Thats why tinkering with the games code and then distributing it is illegal(ergo cracking).

Now with nfts tech. If LRC and gme figure out a way to get the license on the blockchain with nfts.  Then what we now see as an artwork to represent the hyperlink  can be the an unique indentifier to a license to play the game.  Enabling reselling like we used to with discs. This would take a huge chunk of profit out of all the  digital game stores. So thats where I foresee trouble. They need to get them on board as well and prolly they will want  Margin of the each sell.

Its an huge  and risky development if executed properly it might trigger Moass but if it does not than it might actually harm gme. 

I would hope for the best and assume the worst will happen.

Unlike LRC or anything running off ETH, polygon has been pumping opposite times ETH is green which is quite unusual for anything in the Ethereum ecosystem. 

But I have been observing the price action and in my opinion it appears it is trying to remain one day ahead, LRC price. Obviously the best way to get a tokens name out their to the masses is to be a a “top gaining asset.”

"Trying to be devil's advocate here (as I can see the point you are making), that sub always had very strict rules on the number of posts about any specific coin/token that could be on their front page every day. They made exceptions for BTC and ETH a long time ago (both can have a few more posts than others), but LRC might be removed for that reason. This rule has been in effect for quite some time, to reduce people constantly posting about the same news. On that sub, this is especially important, as you can actually earn money by getting upvotes: your monthly earned karma on the sub gets you a ratio of moons, which are a crypto token. So, in order to reduce repost or 'moon' / 'karma' farming, they remove posts about topics that are already frequently mentioned that day (or the last few days, not sure), so this may not be from 'bad intentions'.

"It's hilarious because according to the reddit trackers, ADA and Matic were both mentioned quite a lot more than LRC, yet LRC gets another ban...   


What's annoying is that LRC just had a major release and it's getting censored. I can understand keeping down the endless hype spam, but censoring major news like the counterfactual wallet and RAMP.... I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the market launch gets censored as well.",1640143723,hpigyiy
Well LRC is a token so SuperToken might be better.,1640143255,hpifzg7
"Yep shills have definitely followed apes over to the Loopring sub as well to try and stop loopers becoming apes.

The big crypto subs already seem to be compromised somewhat in that they shill for some coins and don't allow others. Matic promoted over LRC with LRC posts getting deleted on the crypto sub.",1640143028,hpifhue
"“LRC: Slightly less flat”

Up 18% as of right now lmfao",1640142838,hpif3je
LRC up close to 20% on the news is a little bigger than stated IMO. But love the daily ape news 👍👍,1640142643,hpieofu

1. They really are getting spammed and the mods are human and said fuck this shit and decided to tamp down
2. Heard rumors the mods are MATIC holders (proof?) and not a fan of LRC since it’s a competitor
3. Ex-head of Reddit/Mr. Williams invested a hefty amount in Polygon/Matic. Could obviously still be ties between him and Reddit, esp given Moons as part of the CC subreddit
4. Mods want to be LRC whales and would rather buy in huge amounts at low prices, ramping down exposure until it runs up with GME NFT marketplace
5. Hedgies spamming the mods/sub on our behalf which led to the clampdown

Just a few theories there, not all are necessarily evil but mods there have handled it not great from what I see",1640141762,hpics1y

"To be a tedious stickler on the details, Finestone is a businessperson but not an engineer. Stealing from [his resignation letter](https://matthewfinestone.medium.com/thank-you-loopring-16993766c200):

&gt;Loopring is primarily an engineering-focused team, with 21 of the 25 teammates being engineers. I am not an engineer. With these ingredients — being in the West, and being on the business side of things — I’ve had the privilege to play a unique role, and to some, I was the face of Loopring, just by virtue of going around to all the Ethereum events or being on interviews, while my teammates actually built the important stuff that moved the needle. 

He's obviously being very modest about his contributions to LRC here, but it is worth pointing out that he helped to build LRC from the ground up *from the business side*, not the technical side.

Given the success of LRC so far he definitely seems like a great pick to help build GME's fledgling crypto venture, and his familiarity with LRC would certainly make that sort of partnership sensible. I just don't want anyone to be under the impression that GME hired the *founder* of LRC - Daniel Wang is still founder &amp; CEO over there.",1640019919,hpbbp1q
LRC is being pumped and dumped regularly by Hedgies. No use investing in rn.,1640018501,hpb88ml
"You don’t need mask to buy LRC. If you do then the thousands of LRC that I bought with USD on Gemini are fake. You don’t even have to transfer ETH or anything out of Gemini to use Flexa. It’s already integrated. You don’t have to use LRC to use Flexa. There are more than 25 available currencies in the app. Slightly less in Gemini. In fact, you can use GUSD. It’s a simple as clicking a tab and showing the clerk the QR code. Transferring to Gemini is a simple ACH away. 

What’s harder? Pulling up a QR code with GUSD sitting in your Gemini acct or pulling out the fiat? It’s the same. It just sounds like you’re intimidated by something new.",1640018090,hpb794f
"No

This is not a LRC sub

If there is no GME partnership, I will forever be anti-LRC for honey-potting the shit out of us",1640017769,hpb6hqn
"This has nothing to do with LRC. I never once mentioned it. My brain is smooth af, and as far as I know, LRC probably has nothing to do with GME, just like how crypto con had nothing to do with it. They’re probably throwing out GME to hype their own agenda and it amounts to nothing. All I know is I like the stock, I’m invested, and running down the clock to lower capital gains. The longer this drags out, the less Im paying in taxes. For now, I’ll stay home, play Xbox, act like I don’t know a thing because i really don’t.",1640017652,hpb67qc
"Why do we care what LRC is worth though? I get caring about the technology and all that, it's been posted 1000 times in this sub.

Who cares what the price of the token is if you're in GME?

And that ATH is from LRC pumpers in here for like 3 days while Mods let the spam through",1640017455,hpb5qy8
"Except you posted it to a GME sub

You're trying to pump LRC as it's down like 50% since it first got pumped in here",1640017108,hpb4wx6
"If you read it, its bullish for LRC. I don't see any desperation. It's just stating LRC is the probable future or something like it for crypto to be used in more transactions with miniscule gas fees.",1640017007,hpb4oce
Good for you if you're holding Lrc. But this is gme sub.,1640016864,hpb4c35
But why would you buy both instead of just concentrating it all into gme? It's an honest question I would like to know why there are so many people hopping onto LRC and if it's worth investing in,1640016601,hpb3pml
Could you please explain to me why you would rather use money to buy LRC (not an official gamestop related product) rather than using your money to buy more GME to potentially lock the float faster? Splitting investments doesn't seem like the best idea to me.,1640016022,hpb2d54
"Skepticism is fine, but this sub borders on paranoia. Some of you need to go for a walk. 

You have no proof one way or another that LRC is/isn't connected to GME.",1640016016,hpb2cms
"LRC needs to detach itself from BTC. It is a little unnerving watching my holdings drop like a rock, knowing the crypto crash is upon us and BTC 5-10k is likely.",1640014610,hpaz3u7
haha...sorry yeah LRC gang is catching wind of the GME MOASS and are hopping on board,1640013918,hpaxj69
Lol I honestly don’t even know if your talking about fomoing into gme or lrc. They are both dippin. I would love moonshots on both tho I’ll tell you that,1640013272,hpaw2ro
"I mean, LRC already has a layer 2 wallet but it's not free to setup. You have to pay gas fees to set it up and transfer to it. So if you want, you can get it now. 

However the CF wallet they are working on will be essentially free to make. So if you're not knowledgeable about crypto, probably best to wait until they release that and take the easy on ramp which will surely come with step by step instructions.

It's not like Robinhood where anyone can turn off the buy button. Worst that might happen is Coinbase might wine and kick and scream for a day or two as everyone transfers their loops out.",1640013223,hpavyt3
LRC apes FOMO'ing in is gonna be huge,1640012353,hpau2jv

I want assets that are going to WORK. It takes money to buy whiskey.


Gme the one idiosyncratic risk. DRS",1640011530,hpasb5r
"No, you?

I mean, yeah, there is the appearance of ""many people are doing it"", but seeing as LRC is plateauing, it doesn't look like there is that much buying of it.",1640010936,hpar21l
"funny I just dropped a couple bucks on LRC again, since it's down to $1.96 lol",1640010596,hpaqclg

"Yup, Flexa is a nothing burger. Plus only a fool uses crypt0 for payments.

Dont worry I got downvoted too when I said it.

Just like when I explained that LRC is not a store of value but rather a utility token.

You will learn that when the truth doesnt fit bias around here you get slammed🤣 

If you get downvotes for solid facts, you are correct 99% of the time. The sub has proven this to me many times in the past year.

Goodluck ape! I hear you.",1640009322,hpansr5
"Said this on another post that was the same screenshot, but that definitely looks like one of us posted that in the LRC sub. Nobody talks like that irl. I dont disagree , I just think 8ts funny there's a real life "" how do you do fellow loopers"" comment",1640009150,hpangr0
Question: is there something I can do to prepare for when this LRC 2 layer protocol goes live?,1640009043,hpan97g
"BEAUTIFUL! There aren’t enough of us on GME to lock the (probably ~63M) float. We need to spread the word about DRS to the masses outside of GME and outside of Reddit. Loopers would be a prime example! I know very little about LRC or crypto, but those of you who go there, please share DRS message all you can. Don’t give the hedgies “one more day”!",1640008940,hpan240
"The ""smart wallet"" is mobile-only. The desktop version is an exchange, not a wallet, where connecting an existing wallet is necessary to benefit from L2 trading. So you have set up your wallet on mobile. You can wait for the ""free"" wallet, but that won't help with the cost of getting it over from Coinbase. Moving from Coinbase to your LRC wallet costs gas. Then moving from your L1 (Ethereum) to L2 is another gas fee, but not necessary. If you don't move it to L2 in your wallet, you can then connect to the desktop exchange and trade on L2, you just won't be able to from your phone. And the free wallet coming up, if I understand correctly, will allow directly purchasing from the wallet, but that won't do anything to cover transferring your existing assets to Loopring (they're not charging you, by the way, these are all ""gas"" fees, not Loopring being greedy).",1640008636,hpamh6b
"Reeducating myself, might be able to help in a year. 

Just a thought: you will want to create a DAO. This system might need its own cryptocurrency to operate. It would be better if the cryptocurrency was vested into people that believe and invest in the idea or help develop it. If not, a majority of the coin could be gobbled up by institutions and possibly bad actors.

"LRC is not just a marketplace for crypto, but a future marketplace L2 Ether based for NFT related products. Its a no knowledge transfer system designed to provide a severe increase in security over alternatives with no or very small gas fees, These gas fees are hampering the adoption of NFT's and other ether based ""smart contracts"". Another feature would be direct loading and unloading from tradition payment systems like Credit and debit cards. 

Whether the market place was created for digital used games, digital content, DRM replacement, replacement for the DTCC as holder of stocks for companies, NFT based browser games, Blockchain based registration of car and home titles: remains to be seen.",1640006864,hpaj7mv
LRC crypto is on sale too. Don’t let that distract you from GME.,1640006833,hpaj5na
"Well, that's not exactly accurate. I jumped on LRC in October (when a bunch of other Apes did too). When I got to the sub, I didn't see any references to GME or Apes and there were maybe 4-5000 members. About 3 days later, Apes arrived in mass and the sub blew up with partnership speculation.

The LRC sub has grown significantly since Apes got in, but let's not pretend that they didn't have their own organically growing community. We just helped to accelerate it.",1640006811,hpaj49m
"I figured as much, in one of the threads people were talking about transfering their LRC out of coins base, when I asked why people are buying LRC I got downvotes lol.",1640006402,hpaiefk
"So I loosely understand loop ring and GME are related, with possible use with future NFT market place for game stop. But are people speculating LRC is the token to use on that market? Or the price of LRC may go up?",1640006263,hpai5no
"I saw that the loop ring update was complete, and then I saw some folks are buying LRC on coinbase and transfering it to the new LRC mobile app - my question is why?

"I've heard the term stablecoin before but never knew how to differentiate what one is which. I have LRC in Coinbase but I'm kind of just hanging on to it, hoping the remainder turns into a profit, since I guess I bought in at one of the top prices. 

Their L2 Wallet have an app to use? I only have a phone and no access to any computer. And I know I tried to open a wallet once on Coinbase since I heard that's in a sense DRS'ing your crypt-0 but they wanted like, iirc $90 to open it, which is A LOT to me, especially right now",1640003349,hpadgnf
"Not OP, but think about tokens as an arcade. 

You pay money (USD/USDT) for the tokens(ETH), which you used to purchase/play for/win tickets (LRC), which you exchange for prizes (NFTs). These prizes will then have their own economy (kids trading etc) that uses the tickets as an underlying fiat.",1637097087,hkwipsj

"Correct me if I’m wrong, but if they don’t even have a director of product marketing for the NFT marketplace then couldn’t they be MONTHS (not Q4) away from announcing the product? Wouldn’t you need a marketing director to launch it the right way?

Hopefully I’m wrong as my GME shares and LRC coins are betting on it.",1637097086,hkwipoq

"if im understanding this correctly, and I may not be, there was an internal transaction of 165M from LRC to L2 by Daniel Wang (or accounts associated with him) where the fees are supposed to be lower. At approximately 2.60 a coin, this is about 63 million coins. This is very close to the GME share count.

"I don’t know much about LRC or coin in general…

I bought a couple 😁 (main is still $GME!)",1637096878,hkwi6lt
"Oh hey, itsa me.

Looks like this means that LRC was transfered from ETH mainnet to Loopring L2.",1637096840,hkwi38e
"That would be uncool because LRC is assigned a value and brokers could pay the equivalent of what LRC is worth instead of handing out the actual dividend.

"The report is nicely packaged info on GME. Easy to share with people instead of sending newbies to real old reddit links.

The report itself is a good gateway into GME. And now with LRC people coming in and having a look, accessibility of the information is very important.",1637096721,hkwhsjf

"If brokers have to buy lrc for their synthetics, it’ll be worth much more than $2",1637096201,hkwggwl
This isn’t what’s going to happen though. Where did you get the idea of an LRC dividend? How does that make any sense whatsoever.. sorry but this just seems like you’re trying to get others to FOMO under the guise those shorting GME need to buy Lrc? There’s no basis for this line of thinking. They are building an nft marketplace and hopefully apes will receive an NFT dividend at some point which is totally different than giving an lrc token or whatever.,1637096166,hkwgdpa
"Maybe not... it could be recurring LRC tokens.

Lots of mental gymnastics here but some kind of quarterly fractionalized LRC token dividend would be far harder to challenge in court because shorts *could* technically purchase them, but it will get exponentially harder and more expensive over time to remain short in the traditional equity markets. Plus this would slowly transfer data onto the blockchain. 

An official partnership in this situation would be like gold for Gamestop as it ensures authentic buying pressure of LRC, which will drive up their own value. No?",1637096108,hkwg89t

I believe in RC. And I believe there's a ***chance*** there is no partnership at all, and GME is building their own marketplace with their own proprietary  technology (look at all the hires for crypto jobs).

"Holy shit. 

I’ve just seen The Everything Squeeze. 

It reminds me of what Burry said about ETFs being a timebomb. 

What if brokers have essentially become ETFs, right? I may have this all wrong. 

Example (and why relevant to GME) -

Looking at what’s happening with Coinbase, it seems that they have sold themselves short of LRC. 

Loopring’s L2 wallet is essentially the DRS of crypto - pulling liquidity out. 

Coinbase appear to be having major issues with FTD, as many holders withdraw LRC to L2 wallet. 

Leading to the conclusion than Coinbase sold LRC they didn’t have (or probably even intend to have) and now they’re desperate. 

So, thinking about ETFs. An ETF *isn’t* the underlying asset, it’s effectively a bet on the underlying. It tracks the asset. Not trades. 

Coinbase basically became an ETF because it stopped actively *trading* LRC (as in, selling it to you) and instead started *betting* (tracking) on LRC. 

Ok, wut GME? RobDaHood did the same thing. They weren’t trading GME with you. It wasn’t a transaction. It was a bet. It was tracking. It’s an ETF. 

What if every broker stopped running actual transactions years ago, and instead they actually are just running casinos?

How do you offer the lowest trading costs to tempt non-traders into becoming traders? BY NOT TRADING. 

How do you lower the cost of entry to a market for low-cost retail trading? BY NOT TRADING. 

Stop seeing stonks as individual assets. 

Start seeing them as chips. $1 chips. $10 chips. $100 chips. 

The tickers don’t matter because they aren’t even trading the tickers. They’re gambling on numbers. They’re gambling on statistics. 

And if withdrawing LRC to the L2 wallet can squeeze Coinbase (as in, they become a buyer that can’t choose when to buy) then it’s just exactly like DRSing shares can squeeze *every fucking broker*. 

It hardly matters what ticker is DRS’d. It only matters that the casino starts to run out of chips.",1637843801,hm10tcx

"I’ll do my best lol

The counterfactual wallet is Loopring’s way of getting people onto Layer 2, thus relieving a lot of the traffic on L1, and lowering gas fees (transaction fees). 

Right now you could:

Buy LRC or Eth on coinbase, metamask, etc. and send it over the the Loopring wallet. This would send the funds over to the L1 portion of the wallet. Then you’d have to pay another fee to send that money to L2. Once the funds are in L2, transactions fees go WAY down (almost 0) and you can move funds through L2 for essentially free. 

BUT

With the counterfactual wallet and fiat on-ramp, you’re automatically given access to L2 AND you’ll have the ability to move fiat from your bank directly to L2! No extra gas fees or moving your crypto around to several apps. 

Now, *if you want to be able to move crypto between L1 and L2* you have to pay an additional fee for that. It seems that Loopring’s goal is to move most people to L2 only; that’s where we’ll see e-commerce happen on a much bigger and more efficient scale.

"Be aware that is not as easy to use as you might think. Technology still very new.

Be also careful that any L1 transaction to L2 cost gas fees so it will cost money.

There is a need to use wallet connect in order to use the ramp features. Right now they have issues with so many people and still fixing things so be patient.

I manage to help solving some issues for international apes. Manage to create a L1 wallet transferring funds from coinbase (85 loops), then activate the L2 wallet with that but costed 36 loops. If you have loops or funds in L1 leave them there.

If you wish to use the L2 counterfactual for free you will need to have a friend that has L2 activated to send you 50 loops in order to activate it. You can send those loops back using L2 very easily and super cheap. I think that’s the best easy way, but also requires a trust me bro that your loops are gonna come back.
 
Best of luck apes.

So far the liquidity pools look amazing. They require equal amounts of both currencies you gonna use on the pool (LRC/ETH for example, you will need to put 50 loops and the equivalent in value on ETH).

"Just to be clear for others: Loopring *protocol* is entirely separate from Loopring Coin (LRC).  

LRC is a cryptocurrency in the same way BTC or ETH is.  

Loopring *protocol* on the other hand is just a way to exchange coins without needing two counterparties. Basically all trades nowadays require exactly two parties- buyer and seller. These parties must have and want the opposite of each other; buyer wants BTC and has USD, seller wants USD and has BTC. This is the typical sense of buying and trading through all of history, until now.    

Loopring protocol introduces the possibility of *n* trading parties, instead of limiting it to exactly 2. Traders are connected in an automatic way such that they all get what they want for the thing they have.  

For example, trader A has USD wants ETH, Trader B has ETH but wants BTC, and trader C has BTC and wants USD. In the traditional pair trading scheme, no pairs of these traders can successfully trade. But if you loop them together in a ring A-B-C(back to A) then all three can successfully trade.  

This hugely improves liquidity, and thus improves prices. You no longer have to find a counterparty who has and wants exactly the opposite of you, now you can trade with nearly any counterparty as long as only one of their has/wants matches yours",1640109377,hpg8777
"How d you get into loopring? you just buy the loopring tockens or what is the purpose of it? i have a wallet on coinwallet, you should send BTC or LRC tokens to the loopring APP?? what is the thing here?",1640109191,hpg7q15
"Okay, first, it’s a SmartWallet. It’s integrated into the Ethereum network, which has robust af security. However, to create a SmartWallet requires signing a smart contract, which costs quite a bit of gas on layer 1 of Ethereum, the network’s congested-ass base level. At low gas fee times lately (~40 gwei) people have been creating their wallets for as low as $25-$35 USD worth of eth, USDC, USDT or LRC. During high gas times, the loopring twitter bot has quoted as much as $450 for wallet creation. Also, instead of having a series of words as your security key, to recover your wallet if you lose access, the SmartWallet has social recovery. You establish Guardians that the system will check with to give you access again. These can be people you trust who have L2 wallets, or any Ethereum address you control. A cold storage wallet could even be used as a guardian. I’ll be making a counterfactual wallet for my wife to be a guardian too.

The counterfactual part is that this wallet wallet puts those costs off until you want to interact with L1. It stay on L2, pretty much for free (saw some comments saying there’s still a small fee, I don’t know, my wallet is already set up and bound), where you can swap by paying either very low 0.3% fee for taker swaps, or you make 0.02% for maker swaps. This wallet may also work in GME’s NFT marketplace. Or it may not, but there may be a built in connection. We’ll see. 

Where a bank gives you half a percent interest to move your money around and make more money for themselves, decentralized exchanges allow you to lend your own funds out to make that lion’s share of profit. You can be the bank. You can be the market maker. 

A final note: no one from loopring or anyone official will ever contact you directly to “verify” or “validate”. Those are scammers trying to get you to interact with a contract that allows them to steal your funds. Gotta say though, GMEricans are pretty adept at spotting shills and scammers after these last 11 months.",1640109079,hpg7fg2

"Transferring out of Coinbase is like DRSing. You can use Metamask or the Loopring wallet or others. I transferred my L1 LRC from Coinbase to Loopring L1 wallet for about 3.5 LRC (not bad at all). Now they are in my wallet and safe as can be, and if I ever want to move them to L2 in that same wallet, I can (and will also pay gas for it). Imma just DRS my Loops for now.",1640108368,hpg5ksd

"CC is the cryptocurrency sub. Loopring is a cryptocurrency, and a decentralized exchange, that now has a delayed-fees SmartWallet and fiat on-ramps. That’s a real stretch of the term brigading. 

CC mods seem to the bitscoins maxis though, and this is huge for loopring and Ethereum by extension. They salty. 

If the marketplace announcement is made, GME will rise to $300-$400. LRC will 5x. Dividend, failed margin call, or some unknown catalyst and GME 🚀 🌝. With power up rewards members getting onto the marketplace, and GME holders looking for something of value to invest their tendies in, the massive adoption of of the Ethereum network could see the top two coins flip. Lots of people don’t want to see that.",1640107905,hpg4e3p

"I need help understanding as my brain is smoother than an baby apes bottom.

Right now I have some crypto in Coinbase. If I want to transfer them to LRC wallet do I still pay gas fees? 

From what I remember (before this) I first have to transfer to MetaWallet first than I can transfer to LRC? Is this still the correct process?

Thanks in advance",1640107431,hpg36k0
You miss out on gains when lrc moons and you are in a pool,1640107146,hpg2g24
I swapped 300 lrc for eth an hour ago so I could swim in the pool.  I'm not even mad and it's a good way to learn.  I'm with you in using it instead of holding shit forever.  Been DCA'ing and hodling since 2015. It gets boring!,1640107103,hpg2c1t

Cool so how do I get my LRC off Coinbase lol,1640106542,hpg0wfp

"I'll echo this. My move was not in my best interest financially. I did this as an experiment. 

I've invested a lot of money in these projects and truly believe in them, especially LRC. So why not contribute to the community that I am banking on thriving? 

Sure, I could just sit on my kriptoe and watch the values increase. But I've done that since 2017. I'm ready to actually use it for what it's meant for and help the ecosystem it is developing.

That's just me though and this is just my play money so take it for what you will.",1640106400,hpg0jpc

"Got it. Thank you for the clarification. So, to make sure I understand, the new update is a fiat on ramp to L2? Does that mean that I can buy ETH/LRC on layer 2 and not have to worry about the ridiculous  GAS fees? Also, I understand that if I want to sell eventually, I'll have to move back to L1, is that correct?",1640105805,hpfz2r8

"You can provide liquidity by having i.e. 100$ and 100$ worth of lrc and giving them to the lrc/usd pool. You earn interest on that, but have the risk of impermanent loss.

Impermanent loss occures when the value of the asset (lrc) changes more than the interest you generate, because then you might lose lrc",1640105427,hpfy4tl

"Guys, I just wanted to provide some info on the Loopring Smart wallet. 

Yesterday I deposited about 7K$ of various kriptoe coins into the wallet and moved them to layer 2 (of course before it was free). From there, I was able to deposit those coins into two liquidity pools- ETH/LRC and LRC/USD. So far, in 24 hours I have accrued 1.40$ in rewards. 

To put that into perspective. I have 20k$ in a savings account that nets me $.90 every 3 months. 

Now, keep in mind, it does cost about 12$ to deposit into the pool, so that isn't free. But the ability to be your own bank here and actually make real interest off of your holdings is amazing",1640103650,hpftqdn

This actually gave me the chills lol. I’ve been keeping loop at arms length from GME to avoid a letdown. I own xxx LRC since October so that also speaks to my belief in Loop.. but they have been somewhat independent investments for me personally. I missed Jan-March but I’ve been holding GME since April and I can do without another short term disappointment from an outside source.

"This wallet is L2 only.

Coinbase is L1.

The purpose of this wallet is to let people try out L2, using the Fiat On/Off Ramp ($-&gt;LRC/LRC-&gt;$) WITHOUT having to touch L1 or pay to set up an L1 wallet. 

So this is no the wallet you want to transfer from an L1, but rather ideally a test wallet for newcomers who don’t have any crypto yet.

If you already have LRC on L1 via Coinbase, you will need a real Loopring Smart Wallet to transfer",1640102041,hpfpvhf

"Flexa accepts LRC now and what loopring does is different from flexa. 

Loopring ( zkrollup/l2) is the protocol the marketplace will be built on while flexa is the payment network. Using flexa, you can purchase items from GME with LRC, but at this point, I literally don't understand why anyone would want to sell their LRC or use them as currency. It's still pretty cool and helping to make crypto more accessible and mainstream.

Hope this helps!",1640139226,hpi73bp
